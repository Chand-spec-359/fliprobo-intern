U Mumba did not look back from that point, sneaking to a 30-27 victory in the ProKabaddi League match at the NSCI stadium on Monday.\\nIt was a match that the Paltan needed to win to be in contention for a semifinal spot; Mumba had already qualified.\\nThough Shabeer Bapu did not play and Fazel Atrachali did not open his account, Mumba attackers Rakesh Kumar (7 points), Anup Kumar (8) were competent enough to make up. For the Paltan, raider Surender Singh and all-rounder Deepak Hooda (6 points each) tried their best but the overall effort fell short.\\nThe Paltan went into the game without talismanic skipper and all-rounder Manjeet Chillar, forcing a reallocation of duties in both defence and offense.\\nThe Paltan defence took off with a neat catch; the left side moved in to trap Rishank Devadiga.\\nThe second time Devadiga went on a raid, Mumba pushed him out of play.\\nMumba came under pressure when Atrachali went out after being touched by Surender.\\nLeading the Paltan in Chillar’s absence, Ajay Thakur came back with a point on his first raid. He also tagged two out on the following raid. Mumba was down to three defenders the third time he went on a raid.\\nOn one of Surendar’s raids, Paltan sought a referral — and won it — after his claim for touch points was negated.\\nFacing an all-out, Mumba captain Anup Kumar stole the thunder with three points — two raid and one bonus.\\nIt was 12-12 when both sides went off for a breather.\\nFor the first time in the match, Mumba was all-out, though within catching range of Puneri at 14-16. With the fans screaming as the home team catchers got into action, the game gained momentum in the closing minutes.\\nSee-sawing developments at that juncture gave Mumba the win.\\nThe result: U Mumba 30 bt Puneri Paltan 27.',\n",
       " 'With Saina Nehwal missing another event due to fitness issues, P.V. Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth will spearhead the Indian challenge at the $120,000 German Grand Prix Gold starting with the qualifiers on Tuesday.\\nSaina, who had injured her ankle last year, is yet to play an international tournament this year as she is trying to achieve full fitness ahead of the prestigious All England championship. In her absence, the onus will be on Sindhu to lead India’s campaign in women’s singles.\\nSindhu, who clinched the Malaysia Masters early in the year, has been going through a rough patch lately as she lost to young compatriot Ruthvika Shivani Gadde in the South Asian Games, before suffering losses to Japan’s Nozomi Okuhara and Korea’s Ji Hyun Sung in the Badminton Asia Championship.\\nThe 20-year-old from Hyderabad, who had also bowed out in the second round of Syed Modi GP after losing to Nitchaon Jindapol, will look to turn around things when she faces USA’s Rong Schafer in the opening round of the German Open.\\nOn the other hand, Srikanth, who clinched the Syed Modi Grand Prix Gold in Lucknow last month, has been in good form and guided the men’s team to a historic bronze medal in the Badminton Asia Championship.\\nThe sixth seed Indian will have a tricky customer in Japan’s Takuma Ueda in the first round.\\nAmong other Indians, young Sameer Verma will meet Ukraine Dmytro Zavadsky, 11th seed Parupalli Kashyap, making a comeback after recovering from multiple injuries, will face Ukraine’s Artem Pochtarev in his campaign opener.\\nIn men’s doubles, Manu Attri and B Sumeeth Reddy will look to have a good outing as the World No. 20 pair is racing against time to qualify for the Rio Olympics.

The two, from Kerala, climbed to the top of the national doubles rankings and were looking ahead to make a bigger mark in the international circuit.\\nBut, Malaysian Tan Kim Her, the new national doubles coach, thought otherwise. He broke up the country’s top-ranked duo and paired Alwin with Telangana’s Tarun Kona.\\nIt takes years to strike a winning combination and Alwin, naturally, was worried.\\nHowever, the duo’s triumph in the Guatemala International Series on Sunday offers him fresh hope that he and Tarun could be a strong pair too.\\nAlwin and Tarun defeated Mexico’s top-seeded Job Castiloo and Lino Munoz 21-8, 21-14 in the final at Guatemala City.\\n“We started playing together three months ago, played three international tournaments and this is our first title… we have sort of settled down with each other,” said Alwin from Guatamela on Monday, a few hours before taking a flight to Peru for the next tournament.\\n“He is a front court player and I play at the back most of the time,” he added.\\nSurprisingly, this is also Alwin’s first International Series title.\\n“I have played well in the bigger tournaments (with Arun Vishnu), won a bronze medal in a Grand Prix and finished runner-up in the Challenge tournaments.\\n“I had won some international tournaments before but they were invitation events… this is my first International Series title,” said Alwin, an FCI employee and the current Kerala State singles champion.\\nBrazil, a bigger challenge\\nAfter Peru, the duo has tournaments in Brazil and Jamaica lined up.\\n“We will get 2500 points from the Guatemala International Series victory, but Brazil is an International Challenge and bigger than this,” said the 28-year-old, who was ranked No. 60 in the world during his partnership with Arun earlier. “The others are the same (like Guatemala).”\\nNo Olympic dreams\\nHowever, despite the recent success, Alwin is not even dreaming of this year’s Rio Olympics.\\n“We’re too new for that, we have just started. Manu Attri and Sumeeth Reddy, who are currently world No. 20, have a very good chance of making it,” said Alwin, who hails from Kollappally in Pala.\\n“I think they have been playing together for the last four years.\\n“Probably, we can think of the next Olympics.

       " 'You either love it or hate it. Users have mixed feelings about Facebook’s ‘Reactions’.\\nHave you ever wondered if clicking the ‘like’ button on the Facebook status update of a friend who lost his pet is the best way to empathise with him? Have you felt that the antics of some politicians warrant a laugh rather than a ‘like’ on the post about them? Have you ever been outraged by an article and felt that liking such a story is nothing short of sacrilege? If your answer is a yes, you are probably a supporter of the latest Facebook offering, ‘Reactions’, that allows users to signal love, haha, wow, sad, and angry as their response to a post. The feature can be accessed if you linger on the ‘like’ button for a while. Netizens are just coming to terms with the offering in the midst of all the excitement of Donald Trump emerging as front-runner for the Republican nominee for the American presidency, and Leonardo DiCaprio finally winning an Academy award. The emojis, Facebook claims, were developed following consultations with sociologists and users of the platform.\\nHR executive Monika Verma feels that the update does not make any sense. “There are no emotions to convey disappointment, shame and fear. Even if you are outraged about a post, it will continue to appear on your timeline. I do not see any point, besides an excuse for Facebook to tweak their algorithm based on our interests. I would much rather keep the old ‘like’ button than have to click on a host of emojis, which, in many cases, may trivialise a serious post.”\\nMedia professional Shalini Nair thinks that Reactions is a great idea. “A ‘like’ button is not capable of portraying any emotion, and does not work for the younger generation, who want to express what they actually feel.”\\nDevendra Pratap, an academic, contends, “I’m not a fan of the new set of emojis, but this was bound to come about. No one has the time or the inclination to actually write in the comments section, and would rather prefer to use an emoji to express what they feel. I think that soon this trend will catch up with most online forums that allow human engagement.”',\n",
       " 'Bengaluru’s flea markets offer exclusive and niche products, often handmade, encouraging a great culture of small creative enterprises. They’re also a good reason to shop and indulge over the weekend, writes BHUMIKA K.\\nThe very word kitsch conjures images of a riot of colour, a mish mash of things, bling, folksy and all things Hippie. It’s moved far from its original meaning of being low brow and veered more towards pop culture. The traditional barter market or santhe has morphed into a space where gourmet food rubs shoulders with modern art and indie music.\\nKitsch Mandi\\nAt the year’s summer season kicks off, the first edition of the year’s Kitsch Mandi was set up at the Pebbles lounge in Palace Grounds this Sunday evening. Young hip people sat under the sprawling Banyan tree, playing carrom, enjoying their beer, while Geetha Navale performed on the veena in another corner. Accessories and clothing held centrestage at the Mandi and one couldn’t get enough of all the beautiful colours and designs, and try to find accessories to match the new buys.\\n(Indulge In gupshup with friends and shopping at Kitsch Mandi Photo: G. P. Sampath Kumar)\\nOne would think that all that online shopping would have dimmed the urge to wade through traffic and land up at the market. But no. It was a squeeze. Two young entrepreneurs — Chanchal Badsiwal with her ‘Chanchal’ brand and Anupriya Dutta Gupta of ‘Howrah Bridge’ — of largely clothes and accessories, were there to make their mark in the “real” world, despite selling online. “People who come here to such markets are looking for exclusivity. Once they come and see what I have to offer, they can always order online form me the second time. You’ll find none of my stuff on any other site,” says Anupriya with confidence. Chanchal, who gave up her corporate career to set up her craft-based enterprise says that such markets attract the discerning buyer, who won’t buy online, even if it’s cheap. “And it’s for those who know their weaves and craft and understand what goes into what they buy.”\\nThen there are people like architect Yatish, who are here for fun. A traveller, he was selling transparent black and white prints of photos from his India travels, with the board “Take what you love, pay whatever you like!” “The physical experience of having someone look at my pictures and react gives me a great high. I do this for fun. Some people may pay less, but other generous people compensate for it. I don’t like to put a price to my work,” he declares. The lemon tea stall run by transgenders was another huge draw.\\nLaila Vaziralli, co-founder and creative head of Kitsch Mandi, says she started it as an experiment, “as a reaction to the formality of the art world. I wanted to create a space where artists and designers could share their work in a casual and inspiring environment. I also wanted it to be a space for people with unique ideas to come together.” Kitsch Mandi started in 2011, and is now over 40 editions old, covering Bangalore, Pune, and Mumbai.\\nIn the past they have had performance acts like Kutle Khan and troupe from Rajasthan, Kabir Cafe from Mumbai, Frase from Canada. mallakhamb rope dancers, stand up comedians, sand animators. “Our music supports new indie and fusion bands from the country and abroad. Our product stalls are all curated, and that’s why we only feature a select 50 stalls at each event. We look for innovative design, sustainability, and uniqueness.”\\nLink: facebook.com/kitsch.mandi\\n(Life is Beau-tea-ful At Kitsch Mandi\\'s chai stall run by transgenders Photo: G. P. Sampath Kumar)\\nChai pe charcha\\nPurushotttam and Bhuvan were busy at Sunday’s Kitsch Mandi making and pouring out steaming cups of lemon and mint tea — the Sulemani Chai, to the enthusiastic milling crowd. The transgenders were there with their mentor, artist/filmmaker Poornima Sukumar. Poornima, who made a film on the community as part of her Aravani Art Project, wanted to continue her association with them, and integrate them into the mainstream of society. “There are people who want to connect with them,” she observes.\\nBhuvan was really busy with making the tea; they had already served up 200 cups by early evening. “We also feel happy doing this. It means we don’t have to only beg or do sex work for as living,” said Purushottam, pouring out the tea. It wasn’t the first time he’d made tea. “I cook regularly at home.”\\n“When we get a chance to run a tea stall like this, other people will also know that there are many possibilities and opportunities. No one today has looked at us in a discriminating manner, unlike outside.” Purushottam otherwise works at Samara, an organisation that helps transgenders deal with community issues like getting voter ID cards, ration cards etc. With the kind of response they got, they hope they will be able to set up a small tea joint sometime in the not too far off future.\\n(From the heart: Techs and Fleas is a flea market made for the bored techie)\\nTechs and Fleas\\nIf Bengaluru is the land of techies, then a flea market made just for them is not such a big surprise. Deepthi Ismail, founder of ‘Thank God Its Sunday’ came up with the idea of “Techs and Fleas” — a flea marker for the IT company employees in the city.\\n“I’m from an IT background, and wanted to make a change in the IT environment — our flea is seen as a welcome break for professionals from their monotonous life!” she says. This flea features a mix of products that range from handmade goodies to commercial everyday supplies. “We always make every market theme based, according the season (they’ve just concluded their Valentine Day theme), so a person walking in will always feel there is something new each time.” Street magicians, hip hop dancers, belly dancers, beat boxing, fire jugglers, dramas or skits that give out a social message, live workshops, are other regular features.\\nThey have hosted fleas at Manyata Embassy Business Park, Embassy Golf Links, RMZ Infinity and RMZ Ecospace.\\nNext event: March 3 & 4\\nWhere: Manyata Embassy Business Park\\nLink: facebook.com/thankgoditssunday\\nSunday Soul Sante\\nIt\\'s a mela kind of atmosphere charged with colour, food, lights, trinkets, pots, paintings, candles, knickknacks and more at SSS. Five years ago, one of the oldest flea markets of Bengaluru took shape in the hands of entrepreneur and craft enthusiast Asha Rao, who\\'s been in the business for over 25 years, with two craft stores behind her.\\nThe Sundal Soul Sante has hosted over 20 editions till date, including two charity events, points out co-founder Sanam Malhotra, a teacher who was on a sabbatical when Asha asked her to join in. A large chunk of people who sell their handcrafted goods at the flea are surprisingly those who have worked in the IT industry, but quit their jobs to follow their passion, says Sanam. Many others are homemakers. \"I only see people\\'s creativity growing with each passing year. We\\'ve had to say no to so many because we don\\'t have space,\" muses Sanam.\\nSSS as its popularly known, is also one of the largest curated fleas, with somewhere between 250 and 280 stalls. \"In the last three years, we have made it strictly art and craft oriented. We don\\'t allow people who merely import or source products to participate. The participant must either be making the products they bring, or at least designing them.\"\\nTwo stalls are set aside for crafts persons who can\\'t afford to pay for stalls and come from the city\\'s outskirts and nearby places like Mysuru.\\nWith summer blazing bright and spring in the air, the coming SSS in March is themed all things neon! Around 50 food stalls, performances by local bands Best Kept Secret and USP, and international band Massive Vibe, belly/fire dancers, the African drum circle where people can join in with some enthusiastic drumming, and a themed fashion show by Prasad Bidapa are on the cards.

       " 'The first edition of the Whitefield Art Collective showcases the coming together of many artistic worlds\\nOne of the biggest among all the strengths of art, is that it can make you smile. That is exactly what the first edition of the Whitefield Art Collective on display at the VR Bengaluru space does.\\nThe collective, organised in collaboration with artchutney.com, showcases a dazzlingly large collection of art (by more than 75 artists) in a mall space, featuring installations, sculptures, paintings, and photography across several floors.\\nIt is art that greets the mall visitor immediately upon entering the grounds of the mall known as ‘Black Box’, with a large black bell made of recycled rubber slippers washed ashore the ocean. Created by Siddharth Kerkar and titled ‘Unexpected Blessings’, the work can make 25 tunes, with the ‘unexpected ringing’ symbolizing ‘unexpected events’.\\nIt is just as surprising to see so much art spread out over the grounds outside the mall.\\nThe grounds feature large installations by several artists, among whom are Subodh Kerkar, who draws connections between history and the ocean through his installations featuring boats; Shail Suneja who creates a vertical, multi-tiered structure using layers of material including sand and brick to depict the relationship between urban architecture and lifestyle; and Farahad Hussain, who had painted over a bright yellow electric car auctioned to an NGO. Subodh Kerkar is among the most prolific artists in the exhibition showing three installations, ‘Bubblegum God’, a catamaran (Indian) on which the head of Moai god from Easter Island is perched blowing a bubblegum (New York); ‘The Boats’, featuring an upright boat and ‘Chillies’, featuring large, vivid red fiberglass, cotton-covered chillies. “My works are about the connected histories and the stories of the Indian Ocean. The ocean is a perpetual inspiration in my works; it is there both inside and outside my work. The ocean is a sculptor of our culture and our histories, it creates histories,” he explains.\\n“Almost 60 per cent of world trade once happened in the Indian Ocean. For instance, chillies in India are one of the biggest repercussions of the Portuguese intervention in India. There is no other product, no other object which has been introduced by another country, which has become so popular that the recipient country cannot do without it. This makes us realise that globalisation started as early as 2500 B.C.” The most eye catching art work in the collective is Vikash Kalra’s ‘Limitless’ featuring 26 fibreglass sculptures from 50 inches to 12 feet, depicting largely, human figures in rapture. The figures captured often mid-run or mid-jump, surround fountains.\\n“These sculptures showcase the sheer joy of doing and thinking nothing, just like a child who runs and jumps all day yet doesn’t get tired. The child looks at the world with wonder. This is a reminder to get in touch with the child inside us, just for a little while,” says the Delhi-based artist.\\nThe atrium features an installation of a magnified water drop by Guinness-record holding artist Kalyan Rathur as well as paintings by artists such as Pragnesh Patil.\\nThe rest of the mall space is largely dedicated to paintings (fine art) by over 48 artists including Drubajyoti Baral (Indian, semi-abstract figures in tempera), Shan Re (abstracted lines), Jyoti Hattarki (bright folk figures), Mrunalini Giri (archival ink on canvas), Vinita Dasgupta (figures formed by the folds of cloth), and Moutushi Chakraborty (old photos on wallpaper)\\nThe inside of the mall is also dotted by a few installations, the most engaging among whom are ‘Blow with the Flow’ by Ravi Shah — a wooden figure facing a painting of a stream flowing through between gaps in trees, ‘Symphony 2’ by Romi Revola — a water feature in stainless steel to raise awareness on water conservation and ‘Blow Horn’ by Puja Bahri — human-sized fibreglass figures in pop colours with their heads covered in a box used for traffic signals to depict voyeurs.\\nThe exhibition features works by veteran, professional, freelance, upcoming and student artists on a wide ranging of topics. The mall will also host some permanent artworks, mainly murals by Murali Cheeroth on the historical iconography of Bangalore, Thara Thomas who paints a ‘time-capsules’ depicting stories from the Whitefield station and a hanging, life-size metal sculpture by Dimpy Menon.\\n“The sculpture depicts two forms, a male and a female acrobat. They both look upwards, as though in wonder or looking for inspiration, it is a positive gesture. They hold each other’s hands, the sculpture depicts the synergy between the male and a female. There is a ribbon that encircles them and reaches upwards, in the spirit of reaching out.”\\nThe Whitefield Art Collective will be on display until March 13 at VR Bengaluru, Whitefield Road, Mahadevpura.

       " 'Textile designer Rema Kumar is on a mission – to repopulate the land of the sari with the traditional attire, albeit with a modern touch\\nWhen you think of a sari, most of us think of our mother and grandmothers, but Delhi-based textile designer Rema Kumar is out to change that perception and inspire younger generations to don the attire regularly.\\nIn town to showcase her latest collection at the Ambara Store recently, she shares with MetroPlus on making saris wearable for one and all.\\nAt first glance, it’s noticeable that she wears her own collection. “Even if you drop by my house unexpectedly, I will be in a sari. While designing, I keep in mind function and comfort, so that women can wear my saris all day without feeling it is a hassle.”\\nHer passion would inspire everyone to wear saris on a regular basis.\\n“The frequency of wearing a sari is becoming exponentially more diluted for every new generation. I want to stop that. I want to bring back the days where women, young and old, took joy in draping the sari. It is so feminine and strong. The sari shouldn’t be associated with religious functions or yearly occasions. It is our tradition and we shouldn’t let it die. We applaud younger girls who have taken to wearing saris to work, when out with friends, and any other regular day. What people don’t realise is that if the production of saris decreases, the number of weavers will also decrease. With the loss of weavers, we will be losing certain patterns and designs that are handed down traditionally. A massive part of Indian culture will be lost. We need to re-popularize the wearing of the sari.”\\nRema took to designing at a young age.\\n“Back home in Kerala, when I was in ninth grade, I took a keen interest in the stitching of my frocks. Though I went in a different direction in my higher studies, I was still keen on stitching and design. I eventually found what I was looking for in a post graduate course in textile design and cloth.”\\nRema affirms that she has had a long journey, “but every struggle adds up to the final product.”\\nElaborating on the pan Indian nature of her saris, Rema says they cannot be associated with any particular state apart from the base design.\\n“I moved from Chennai to Delhi and found that the trends in the Capital are different from those in the South.\\nI wanted to use traditional weaving techniques but on lighter cotton fabrics instead of wool. I approached many weavers to try some radical designs and successfully convinced some weavers to even weave plaid textile for some of my designs. The sari travels many places before the finished product is seen. It might take up to a month or sometimes longer to complete one sari design. I have been working with Uttarkhand weavers to make woollen saris lighter. I maintain the same colours of the region and try not to stray far from traditional designs.”',\n",
       " \"Mallika Taneja, in her solo satirical performance, Thoda Dhyaan Se, challenged the notion of what women should do, and wear, to be ‘safe’\\nTwenty years ago, it wouldn’t have been possible to speak about such issues, said an elderly gentleman. But now you have platforms to show such work, he added. This was said at Mallika Taneja’s solo performance, Thoda Dhyaan Se. But have times really changed?\\nOr are women’s issues still not understood enough? Is it true that despite more ‘platforms’ being available to talk about women’s sexuality, it’s still difficult for society to understand the harassment women face on a regular basis? Judging from some of the responses after Mallika’s solo act, held recently at Max Mueller Bhavan/Goethe Institut, there still seemed to be some confusion.\\nThoda Dhyaan Se primarily addressed the ‘caution’ women should follow when it comes to what she wears, how she talks, where she goes, what time she should return home, to be ‘safe’, while all along she is held ‘responsible’ for any mishap that might occur, while men, were free to letch and grope.\\nMallika carried off the performance with aplomb, absolutely assured in the statement she made. It traced the life of a young girl in Delhi whose father wants her to be ‘safe’. And she obeys every injunction thrown at her by a patriarchal society. Even though she is overwhelmed by layers and layers of clothing, which to me signified layers of oppression, I found the performance simplistic. Do questions about women, just encapsulate the body? Are experiences for women across class and caste the same? Women's issues, are far more complicated and require deeper questions to be asked. This uni-dimensional approach had a positive outcome — it made the audience ponder over the performance, well after it was over, on the other narratives of women’s oppression.\\nThe post-performance discussion had an audience member ask Mallika what triggered the performance. She said that even though there were horrific rape cases, such as Shakti Mills of Mumbai and the December 2012 Delhi rape, there wasn’t any need to situate it within a particular event; that being groped and touched inappropriately in buses, for example, something most women face, were really the ‘triggers’.\\nIt came as no surprise, however, that within 10 minutes, the discussion was dominated by men. Some were sympathetic and sensitive, while others didn’t get the point of the performance. The irony was lost on them, to the extent that some of them reinforced typical patriarchal judgments. Several times, Mallika urged women to speak up. And though there were some responses, and a particularly emotional and disturbing experience shared, the silence was telling. So it makes me wonder again, despite platforms and several articles written and questions raised, is there still a long way to go for women to break their silence completely?\",\n",
       " 'The city’s buzzing college fests offer a golden opportunity to socialise and grow leadership skills\\nA few days ago, as the Gachibowli campus of IIIT was all decked up to host its prestigious annual tech-fest Felicity, the surroundings hinted at a theme, Magic and Mystery. Ideas were pouring in from several corners, mysterious theories were being spouted, and predictably, Harry Potter was a major draw. It was a big day for Jeevan Chowdhary, a third year engineering student who’d given his heart and soul to organising the event. Besides being actively involved in its behind-the-scene activity with his team for eight months, he was also a founder of a startup, so leadership came more naturally to him than others.\\n“There were campus elections that I had to surpass to lead the organising team. We had to ready a manifesto, talk on the mistakes our seniors had made in the past, what I could bring to the table and circulate it throughout the college,” recalls Jeevan. As the fest comprising, as many as 200 events took off, it was impossible for him to be there at all venues so he had to delegate different tasks to his batchmates and juniors.\\nAround the same time, Sai Ram Tangirala, the secretary of the annual lit-fest, Verba Maximus at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad was busy catching up with friends from IIT, Madras who had gathered at his college. He had met them at the IIT campus, the previous year. “I always looked forward to the fest to interact with students from other colleges. We get to bond with people coming from Chennai, Mumbai and several parts of the country. This works as a good student-exchange strategy among ourselves to attend fests,” he opines.\\nFrom facilitating and enhancing networking skills to helping students get better at man-management and speaking skills , this season of college fests provide students, a great learning curve, amassing things they’d label as ‘wonderful memories’ after they graduate. “The learning that happens at a fest, be it the experience of being a team player, is no match to a classroom atmosphere. It builds the feeling that you’re part of the college. You’ll find yourself in moments like these, your interests, culture, fine arts or even literature,” says Anjana, a final year degree student at St Francis Begumpet.\\nThough this is also a time when ego clashes happen, students learn, perhaps the hard way that there’s a fine line to be maintained to ensure equations aren’t strained. Jeevan and his core team had a plan to counter this. “We made it a point to recognise people for their strength in front of all the batch members. We insisted that they be the face of the fest and that we’ll only be in the background and set the platform for them. We made sure the work was very organised besides ensuring the volunteers, due credit.” On the other hand Anjana opines that the honesty with co organisers is what counts, it’s a balance between being diplomatic yet tactful.\\nThen there are students who’re just finding their way, like Aishwarya, a first year student of CBIT, looking forward to fests for a possible direction. “I’ve attended three fests at different colleges now. It was challenging to know to the standards I’ve to match up to. Having ambitions to lead and organise such fests myself, I felt it necessary to be a part of them.”\\nOn sponsors, celebrities controlling fests\\n“Fests, alike a product, are brands of sorts. The number of years the fest was successful, the intra-college freedom are huge factors that sponsors look at. There needs to be a structure in place to ensure that campus politics, celebrity presence don’t dilute them”- Vasant Kumar Jurru, Founder of Arts Club, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology\\n“We have a strict policy of not bringing celebrities to colleges. The personality takes over the attention and it’ll be doing grave injustice to the efforts, that hundreds of volunteers together would have put.”- Jeevan Chowdary, Organiser, Felcity, IIIT\\n“We only invite celebrities at the concluding stages of the fests so that there’s some relaxation happening too. So, the question of celebrity earning more attention than the fest doesn’t arise.”- Sai Ram Tangirala, BITS-Hyderabad',\n",

       " 'Artist: Bloc Party; Album: Hymns\\nFor a band that loves to be alternative and quintessentially British in its way of innovative electronic elements, Bloc Party opts for chill times on its new album Hymns. The indie rock band released its last album, Four, in 2012 and now has two new band members – bassist/synth player Justin Harris and drummer Louise Bartle.\\nOf course, it’s not the same without Matt Tong and Gordon Moakes adding their signature rhymthic, nearly mathematical phrases, but it’s not like that’s what Bloc Party are going for on Hymns. It’s very much a return to their love-laced and synth-led sound of 2008’s Intimacy. While their lead single “The Love Within” is made for dance clubs, “Only He Can Heal Me” and “So Real” sound as Brit rock as they can get, with the synthesizer adding happiness, juxtaposed with vocalist Kele Okereke smooth pop hooks.\\nBloc Party does change gears out of nowhere, like they did on Four, so the country-Western/bluesy number “The Good News” takes us by surprise, becoming a completely different band. Okereke, whose voice is pretty much the most important thing on this album, is open and direct about his musical direction now, as he sings on “Into the Earth: “Rock’n’roll has got so old/ Just give me neo-soul.”\\nWhen he does take centre stage, Okereke’s vocals impress for the most part but often fall into unoriginality, like his soft soul/pop melodies on “Fortress”. But if you’re a fan, you’ll probably be more swayed by the lyrics about modern life and evangelism on Hymns. The so-called spiritual undertones are prevalent, but this is the sort of album you expect from any other British indie rock band. The Bloc Party we all learnt to love could throw in a bout of aggro whenever they wanted, instead of settling deeper and deeper into layers of hypnotic synth like on “Different Drugs”.\\nFans probably won’t have a problem with Bloc Party’s evolution into the chill electronic rock sound, but let’s hope they still have something to rage about in the future.',\n",
       " 'Crafts World, started by three women, offers creative handmade products\\nBengalureans love to craft and we know this by the growing number of professional crafters in the city. Nandini Subramanya is one of them. She worked as a HR professional for four years before she found her true calling to create.\\n“I was always passionate about arts and crafts and got a chance to exhibit a few of my works at work during events and didn’t expect it would be a hit. That’s what inspired me to start Craft World (https://www.facebook.com/CRAFTWORLDPROJECTS) in 2012,” says Nandini. While she started off on her own initially, she now has two other partners, Radhika Rupesh and Archana Anand, who are also her cousins. Nandini started off making murals, paintings, and a few recycled products. “Later I came across felt material through various sources and was interested in doing something with this medium.

       " 'Gaurav Singh and Sainath on what went into the making of their three-minute film Muted\\n“ Life is a dream for the wise, a game for the fool, a comedy for the rich, and a tragedy for the poor”.\\nThus begins the three minute short film, Muted, written, conceptualised and directed by Gaurav Singh. Poignant words in a deep film.\\nFun fact, though, is that Gaurav is only 21 years old and so is is most of his team.\\nMuted won an award at the ‘YES! I am the Change’ 101-Hour Social Filmmaking Challenge in the Student Category, among five other prizes from various colleges. Gaurav, and a large portion of his team, are all fourth year engineering students from MVJ College of Engineering.\\nIn an informal interview over coffee, Gaurav and his main man and editor, Sainath, give us a peek into the life of two engineering students for whom art is everything, particularly cinema. And their passion is contagious.\\nExcerpts\\nTell us how this started?\\nGaurav: This started with a college fest two years ago. We had to make a short film, and decided to go for it.\\nIn the process of conceptualising and making that film, I realized the immense joy I got in doing so!\\nWe were hooked. Visual impact is the best impact.\\nSainath: It was this “Dekho, Seekho, Sikhao” campaign, and we started loving the idea of films with a social message.\\nWhat was the journey of Muted like?\\nGaurav: The thing is, all of us in our team have a soft spot for beggars.\\nThis film explores the story of the begging mafia in India. You see, no matter how much you give them, be it Rs. 10,000 or a lakh, it’s a finite amount that will eventually run out one day.\\nIf you really want to help him, you need to put at end to his situation, and educate him or bring him out.\\nThat’s why the movie ends on that note, thus explaining the title.\\nIt ends with the lines ‘Why do I always forget? Before we lose our limbs, we are muted forever’, depicting the silence they are forever cursed with.\\nI was trying to open up a beggar’s life.\\nWhat are your other interests, besides filmmaking?\\nSainath: I love building and creating things, and making something new. That’s why I have a passion for editing -- cutting, moving and creating one whole from the given pieces gives me a rush.\\nI also love music, and I used to sing before the film bug bit me.\\nGaurav: There literally are no other interests! I’m shooting even this weekend. It’s college during the week and filming during weekends.\\nThat’s me. Of course, I do love cooking for my family and friends.\\nWhat next for you two?\\nGaurav: I’ll probably take up a job, but continue working on my films. That will never go away.\\nI believe in the impact of visuals and want to use that impact to try to create social change.\\nWe have worked with independent groups like The Logical Indian to do so. Before getting into films wholly though, let’s start by getting a job to fund my cinematic projects!\\nSainath: I’m interested in robotics, but let’s see where that goes in tandem with my passion for editing.\\nMy dream would be to work with Andrew Jackson, one of the best visual effects supervisors in Hollywood, and perhaps, even overtake him one day!\\nDo you have plans of following up on your engineering careers?\\nBoth groaning in unison say, “Don’t even ask!”',\n",
       " 'The outspoken actor in a chat on life in tinsel town\\nSuddenly, Radha Ravi is everywhere. He’s been around for ages in films — from 1976, to be precise — but the son of M.R. Radha is now being sought after for interesting character roles. He’s working with young filmmakers, and enjoying every moment of it. Excerpts from an exclusive hour-long chat:\\nAfter more than 300 films and 42 years in the industry, you’ve almost got a now a new lease of life with thanks to strong roles in Irudhi Suttru and Jil Jung Juk. How’s it working with new-age filmmakers and youngsters?\\nI love the new brand of directors; they’re coming up with such interesting scripts. At one end of the spectrum, you have boys with Madurai-based stories, and then, at the other, you have superb storytelling in films set in Chennai. Personally, Aranmanai 2 was one of the highlights in recent times. And, both Irudhi Suttru and Jil Jung Juk were great experiences.\\n\\n\\nComing up\\nEnnodu Vilayadu, Thaneer Thaneer, Server Sundaram, Manithan, Mapla Singam, Enkitta Mothathe, Marudhu, S3, Sangli Bungli Kadavathara\\n\\n\\nTwo of the films you mention have relatively new directors; Sudha has done one Tamil film before and Deeraj is a freshera debutant…\\nDeeraj is a chinna pulla; I couldn’t even call him ‘sir’, as he’s my son’s age. Sudha, having studied under Mani Ratnam, is a thorough professional. The team called me for rehearsals —almost a first in my 42-year career. The only time I did that was during my first Kannada film; that too, because I didn’t know the language.\\nJil Jung Juk had you in a role that required you to look a little different…\\nI told my makeup man to take inspiration from South African cricketer Hashim Amla for that specific role.\\nSo, you like donning various ‘get-ups’ for your films?\\nAbsolutely. I don’t like it when filmmakers say — ‘Just come like this, sir.’ I like to experiment with my makeup. I wish more filmmakers let me do that.\\nYou’ve held a lot of designations official positions in trade bodies; looking back, how do you see that phase?\\nSee, my father (M.R. Radha) did not hold any designations; I got into such organisations due to certain situations. Sometimes, I feel I’ve wasted too much time and energy in the various associations I’ve been with for about 29 years. Even recently, because some people egged me, I stood for the Writers Association’s elections and won. I’m present in the scene, yes, but I wish to step back a bit, as it consumes my energy.\\nThings have changed drastically over the last few decades, yet but you continue to do important character roles...\\nFor me, the character I play is most important. In one film, I called the hero — a leading star — ‘dei’, because my character was supposed to be like that. I learnt this from Senthamarai annan, who never gave away what his character needed.\\nYou speak your mind quite frequentlyshoot off your mouth quite frequently...\\nI do… and I’ve lost many films due to that. All these years, people have spoken good and bad things about me, but I always end up being discussed.\\nYou are often described as ‘arrogant’. How do you react to that?\\nIn my book, thimiru (arrogance) is nothing but thannambikkai (confidence).\\nYour speeches at That is reflected in all your speeches, which you make at audio launches and film events, especially your way with words, sometimes peppered with expletives, face a mixed reaction…\\nIt’s difficult to react when people bring that up, as if it’s the only thing that matters. I’ve been doing so many other things in life. When someone praises me for some speech uploaded on YouTube, I politely tell them I’ve been acting for many years.\\nSome people say you’re a difficult person to deal with, because of the conditions you lay down even before shooting kickstarts…\\nCall me a white elephant… that’s how I am with respect to certain things. For me, timing and punctuality are important. I’m most comfortable with my team of four — makeup man, driver, etc — and would like them to be with me. And, if shooting is outside the city, I insist on travelling in my car. These are things I’ve followed for long, and will continue to.\\nYou’re known to ace villainous and comic roles, be a villain and comedy artist, but you’ve experimented as well in recent times…\\nActually, I might have been the cause for Rajinikanth’s Lingaa’s dismal outing at the box office; I have always been the baddie in his films, but I played a positive role in that film! I had a tough time because I was not used to it. Pisasu was challenging too; director Mysskin tapped my acting skills well.\\nAre you fond of reading? Do you read often?\\nI’m interested in reading, but, of late, I’ve developed a problem in my left eye and cannot indulge myself much. I love reading about great people’s lives. I read a book on the assassination of Gandhi that featured portions about what Godse had said during those times. I like going through books on Mandela’s life and the struggle he went through.\\nTen years from now, how do you see yourself? A little sober? think you’ll turn out? Would you have sobered down a bit?\\nI’ll be 73 then, and I’ll have the same thimiru and thenavattu (laughs). I might be bogged down a bit due to health issues. I’m quite settled on the family front, and still want to be active, so I will continue working. I never want to be idle. I’d like to be a consultant in the film line. I’d like to produce too. I’d like to set up a studio with a great ambience. Also, I’d like to take up a few theatres and run them.',\n",
       " 'Bringing together Ikat and chic design, Translate presents an exhibition of apparel in the city\\nVinita and Vikas Passary created their brand Translate in 2010 to revive the age-old tradition of Ikat, a dyeing technique to pattern textiles. And their endeavour is to make Ikat relevant in contemporary design. In an exhibition, to be held in Bengaluru, the duo will display their collection of tops, dresses, jackets, kimonos, skirts and bottoms, designed by their in-house design team. Says Vinita: “It is our summer wear line of light weight cotton on which Ikat work is done. Our creative process begins right from the weaving level.”\\nThe chic, contemporary element they bring to the designs is a mix and match solution, and versatile silhouettes. “There are button-down dresses with pockets, and roll-up sleeves. The shapes are simple, yet flattering on the body. There are also saris in cotton and silk,” explains Vinita. She adds that a special process of vat dyes are used that make the textile skin friendly. Then it is pre-washed, pre-shrunk and softened. “The textile is colourfast. It is easier to wash and lasts longer.”\\nThe collection is also suited to Bengaluru’s summers. “This textile works in a climate where it is suddenly cool and then turns hot. The breezy and flowy silhouettes would work well,” says Vinita.\\nAt Translate, they focus on warp, weft, and double Ikat, which is almost extinct. “We make sure we work with double Ikats. For double Ikats power looms can’t be used, it is highly skilled.” Vinita says she works with artisans near Hyderabad. “Entire families are involved in Ikat,” she adds.\\nThe exhibition will be held from March 3 to March 6 at House of Tamaara. Prices start at Rs. 4,000.',\n",
       " \"The Madras Hing Trading Co., located in George Town’s cramped Govindappa Naicken Street, cherishes a fragrant tradition that’s over 70 years old\\nIt’s the kind of smell that can cut you off from the rest of the world. It swallows me like a fog, never to let go; so overpowering, that I’m drawn to its source by invisible strings. ‘The Madras Hing Trading Co.’, announces a small signboard on Govindappa Naicken Street in George Town, and I knock on an old-fashioned glass-fronted door to enter a world that dates back to 1943.\\nIt all began when S. Ramaswamy Iyengar, an influential man in the area — he was president of the Madras Kirana Merchants Association — met with traders who bore precious cargo from as far afield as Kabul. The gum-like substance from the Ferula asafoetida tree, when combined with five other ingredients, could add a unique flavour to certain foods. Ramaswamy stocked the raw material and sold them at his shop in George Town. He went on to produce asafoetida cakes himself, and called his business venture ‘The Madras Hing Trading Co.’.\\n“But due to various reasons, it was taken over by N.S. Seshadri and then by Kamal Asher in 1999. Right now, it is run by Nitin and Amrish Asher,” explains Krishna Janakiraman, who manages the company.\\n(The Madras Hing Trading Co.'s MH asafoetida. Photo: Akila Kannadasan)\\nAsafoetida has one of the strongest smells on earth. Despite travelling thousands of kilometres from the plantations of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan to Chennai, it retains its defining character. That too, after changing several hands as it makes its way through our country. “The smell refuses to let go of me,” laughs Krishna, seated in his small office. “My daughter complains that even the bar of chocolate that I carry in my office bag smells of asafoetida.”\\nTheir neighbour for over three decades, C.V. Ravi has seen the business grow since the days of Ramaswamy Iyengar. “Initially, he sold asafoetida wrapped in dried badam leaves,” he recalls. “The gum, which was called water- kabuli, would be transported in sheep-skin bags. Now of course, tins are used for the purpose.” Ravi adds that until the ‘70s, asafoetida was sold only in the cake form. “It’s now packaged as a powder, as well as in plastic boxes and packets.”\\nDespite being around for over 70 years, The Madras Hing Trading Co. has not expanded beyond counter sales. “But we manage to sell over 200 kg a day,” says Krishna. This is because of its loyal customer base. “The other day, a lady who walked in to buy from us said that she has been coming here since she was six.” He adds that they supply to papad companies such as Lijjat and to restaurants including Ratna Café.\\nAsafoetida was traditionally mixed by hand. Ravi says that the raw material, even in its diluted form, is strong enough to make the eyes smart. But even a pinch of it can enhance the flavour of dishes such as sambar or rasam, and is said to aid digestion. Krishna refuses to divulge details of the manufacturing process. All he says is, “A total of six components are mixed using a machine in our unit in West Mambalam. The technique is secret and so are the ingredients.” Can’t he give away even one of them? Krishna pauses for a moment: “The asafoetida gum.”\",\n",
       " 'The miracle of birth in the dead of night… the author joins the turtle walk as the reptile heads to Chennai’s shores to nest.\\nStreet dogs bark madly at us, confused. What are so many people doing in their territory in the dead of night? We trudge on, along the strip of beach behind the Lighthouse, ignoring their questioning looks. Meanwhile, almost two kilometres away, an Olive Ridley sea turtle is making her way to the shore to build a nest. She is unaware of the party that’s come in search of her and happily sets out digging a hole in the sand with her flippers.\\nOur group consists of some 80 people. Led by S. Anand and N.B. Gopinath from the Tamil Nadu Forest Department and Youssef Labidi from Save A Turtle, we set out on what’s called a ‘Turtle Walk’ at 1 a.m. The walk is a journey on foot along the seashore, to look for Olive Ridley nests, and if we’re lucky, the turtles themselves. “Do not use flash lights,” warns Youssef at the start of the walk. “If you spot a turtle, do not photograph her using a flash.”\\nThe distance between us and the Olive Ridley is reducing by the minute. It’s been almost half-an-hour now and she has finished digging her nest. She starts her business instantly — she has over 100 eggs to send to the world outside.\\nThere’s a commotion ahead — a nest has been spotted. A turtle has left a trail on the sand as it slid into the sea. Anand and Gopi get to work, as we settle on the edges of a boundary they sketch around it on the sand. We watch with bated breath — they poke an aluminium rod into the heaped sand. They are looking for the nest’s core that holds the eggs. Loose sand indicates that it has just been meddled with. Their head bent low and eyes focussed, they investigate the grey-brown sand in the dark. But there’s nothing — it looks like the turtle was scared away after it built the nest.\\n(An Olive Ridley returning to the sea after laying eggs at Marina Beach Photo : S. R. Raghunathan)\\nBut our Olive Ridley that started laying eggs is lucky. Her work is done — she has laid 131 eggs. Now comes the crucial task: covering up the nest so that the eggs are safe. She slides sand over the nest with her two flippers. This takes a lot of effort. She’s almost done. A little bit of sand to top it off, and she will be on her way back...\\n“This is it!” calls out a volunteer. “You’re a lucky bunch. Before you is an Olive Ridley. Now, if you please sit down quietly, we can see it.” We focus on a dark spot beside a cart where the turtle is assumed to be seated. “It is right there,” points out Anand. But we see nothing. It’s too dark. Then, a sprinkle of sand flies from the surface and shines a dull gold under the moonlight. More sand flies up at regular intervals. “The turtle is covering up the nest,” explains Anand. “It will pat the surface once it’s done; on certain nights, when the waves are silent, you can hear the gentle pat of the flippers on the sand.”\\n(Olive Ridley sea turtle eggs at Marina Beach Photo : S. R. Raghunathan)\\nGopi tip-toes towards it and gestures for us to come closer. The grey shell, that’s covered with sand after all the hard work, comes into view. It stops in its tracks — thanks to the flash from mobile phone cameras of some insensitive, over-enthusiastic people. She looks up once with beady eyes, confused, and hits the sea in one quick move.\\nGopi and Anand measure the size of the nest and collect the eggs in a bag; these will be taken to a hatchery in Besant Nagar, where the eggs will be nurtured in an environment that’s similar to their nest. The little ones will be released 45 days later into the sea. “These hatchlings will return to the same coastline to nest, some 15 years later,” says Gopi. Olive Ridleys never forget where they’re from.\\n\\n\\nSaving Ridley:\\n“Olive Ridley numbers reduced by almost 50 per cent across the world, some 15 years ago,” says Youssef of Save A Turtle. The reasons include increased activity along beaches, climate change, and uncontrolled fishing during the nesting season.\\nThe walks are aimed at creating awareness on the need to protect Olive Ridleys. “We’re also educating fishermen to use the turtle excluder device that lets turtles escape from the nets if captured. Without the turtles, there will be no fish in the sea. This is because turtles eat jelly fish — which feed on fish eggs — and keep their numbers under control.”\\nThe turtle walks are on till March 15.

       " \"Sudarshan Chari’s works that are on display at the Chennai Photo Biennale capture more than just a moment. They capture people’s aura\\nSudarshan Chari, a.k.a Vicky, wanted to travel. That was clear to this avid photographer, who had suffered for years from chronic colitis and IBS, that had kept him grounded. The world was slipping by and he had to grab it, somehow. At the age of 11, after his father passed away in a plane crash, his mother moved the family to Madras. He went on to complete his engineering in 1998, but resisted going abroad for higher studies. His gut feeling told him he was bound elsewhere. And that was when Vicky, who had never held a camera before, became fascinated with photography. In 2001, he joined G. Venkataraman and trained under the ace photographer. Two years later, he branched out and launched a successful career in advertising. However, a decade later, increasingly incapacitated due to ailments, Vicky became depressed. He realised amateur photographers across the world were taking interesting pictures. “Anybody with a phone can be a photographer today. The whole image I’d constructed of myself came crashing down!” he says. He started to shoot everyday scenes, preferring a small camera so he could get close to his subjects. This shift in perspective gave him a new lease to find his ability to reveal the hidden. Seeing his nephew prancing behind a curtain, he grabbed his camera. “Mystics have the ability to sense your persona. I wanted to capture the aura of people, their energy, through photography,” says Vicky.\\nSudarshan Chari's works\\nStrangely, Vicky recalls he was not drawn to photography by the magic of taking pictures. He was wooed by the camera’s technology. And who can forget his first love? The first picture for his series ‘Beyonder’, showing at the Chennai Photo Biennale in the city, was shot from his own terrace with his adept knowledge of light, exposure and image. Towards sundown, he focused on the parapet for four seconds, and then panned the camera across for another four, using it like a light-brush. The resultant image is like a painting with textures, perspectives and hazy after-effects. Vicky went to the beach in Puducherry. He lay low on the sand and took a shot of people playing by the waters. All his shots capture actions over time, not just one moment.\\nSudarshan Chari's works\\nNext, a friend from Bhopal, Vicky’s birthplace, invited him to shoot in 2014, 30 years after the gas tragedy. He landed in a world of warm and generous people. An unknown resident offered him his two-wheeler and his unwilling son as escort. After the first ride, the boy became a willing chaperone. A conservative Muslim family opened their home and allowed him to take their portraits. In Bhopal, Vicky discovered how his instinct could open up the photographic moment. At a fair, he took a snapshot of a woman paying a vendor for a balloon she had bought for her son. A friend who saw the photograph noticed that the mother was still getting change from the vendor, while the child clutching the balloon was already eyeing his next acquisition. The image revealed something he did not consciously register, but his mind however had. “I think all of us are time travellers, journeying through space and time, collecting experiences that go into this bank of universal consciousness. And some people know how to tap into them.”\\nToday, professionally, Vicky shoots only an ice-cream brand that gives him complete freedom to do the styling and photography. His observation, ‘People in situations push you into images’ is also true of how we pace our lives.\\nBeyonder is on at Connexions, Crowne Plaza Chennai Adyar Park, through March 2016.\\nObservations of a Time Traveller is on at The Muse, Gallery Veda, in Taramani.\",\n",
       " 'With its vast network of animal shelters, individuals and ethical breeders, Petdom uses technology to make adoption fun and easy\\nPet lovers have a reason to cheer. Adopting and re-homing animals has gotten a whole lot easier, thanks to technology. Petdom, the latest entrant in the pet adoption sector, brings together a network of shelters, individuals and ethical breeders on one platform to address the huge gap in the industry. Set up by three pet lovers — Abhinav Tyagi, Udit Agarwal and Neha Khandelwal — the platform has managed to facilitate nearly 92 adoptions since its inception in December 2015.\\n“I wanted to bring home a four-legged member, and the only information available online was on OLX and Facebook groups. There was no single platform with information on pets available for adoption or background information on the animal – whether it was suited for apartment living or needed a larger home,” says Abhinav Tyagi, adding, “This motivated me to look for like-minded people; we combined our love for animals and technology to set up Petdom.”\\nAbhinav continues, “Petdom is a first-of-its-kind comprehensive pet adoption platform. We leverage technology to bring animals from individuals, shelters, ethical breeders and NGOs under one virtual roof, making their discovery easy. We combine our experience of working in product, business, design and technology companies, and apply our skills to make Petdom possible.”\\nThe basic premise for the start-up is loosely based on the lines of the US-based Petfinder. The platform, apart from listings of pets available for adoption, features details such as health and character profiles of the available pets and information around parenting, under one umbrella, to expedite the adoption process.\\nBut why the name Petdom? “The idea was conceived of when the fifth season of Game of Thrones was aired. That was our inspiration; there are kingdoms for humans, so why not a kingdom for pets? So, Petdom, because pets rule our world,” explains Abhinav.\\nPetdom also filters the availability of an animal based on the filters set by a user. For instance, they wouldn’t recommend a Great Dane for someone living in an apartment. The website and app have a list of filters that one needs to set in place before being able to view or choose a pet. “We’re trying to make the process seamless. Currently, we have only dogs available for adoption, but are working on introducing cats and other animals,” says Abhinav, adding, “Dog owners are required to put up all the information about the pet that they’re looking to re-home, including details of vaccinations and de-worming. The idea is to let a user have a clear idea about the pet they’re going to adopt.”\\nThe company has tied up with other organisations, such as People for Animals, Friendicoes, SPCA, Sanjay Gandhi Animal Care Centre and Sonadi Charitable Trust, to have their adoptable dogs listed on the platform. “At present, we have over 400 dogs listed, and the number is likely to hit 10,000 soon.”\\nCurrently, Petdom is active as a website and an Android app. But work is on to release it on iOS by mid-March 2016. The platform also lets users look for pets listed by specific organisations. “Once a user looking to adopt a pet shortlists an animal, a meeting between the two parties — the user and the person who has listed an animal — is set up. The person looking to adopt a pet is required to sign an agreement that states that they will not ill-treat the animal or use it for breeding purposes. We also carry out periodic checks on people who’ve adopted animals from our platform to ensure that they are well cared for.”\\nWhile Petdom is headquartered in New Delhi, they have a presence in various other cities, and have facilitated adoptions in Chennai, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad, Pune and Mumbai.\\nIncidentally, as most entrepreneur stories go, the co-founders of Petdom, too, held well-paying jobs with reputed companies, before they decided to give it up to pursue their dream. “Fortunately, my father wasn’t too keen on me working for an organisation and encouraged me to go ahead with my plans. While our families were a little taken aback by our decision, with a little convincing they were very supportive. And now, we’re happy finding homes for pets on our platform,” smiles Abhinav.',\n",
       " 'Actor Parvathy on winning her first Kerala State Film Award for the best actress\\nNo prizes for guessing who is the best actress of Malayalam cinema in 2015! Every viewer who saw Ennu Ninte Moideen and Charlie knew that the award had Parvathy’s name etched on it in big bold letters. So when the announcement came in the afternoon today, there was a sense of déjà vu. Parvathy did win the Kerala State Film Award for the best actress of 2015 for her superb act in both the movies that won big time in the awards this year.\\nHowever Parvathy is “amazed.” She says the confidence that her friends and fans had in her “overwhelmed her”. “It was scary. I did not expect the award at all. There were so many good movies made in 2015. We have not seen all the movies. I, for instance, have not seen the second best movie. So every time people made it look that I was sure to get the award, I would become a little worried,” says the actor, graceful and dignified in her achievement.\\nParvathy won the award for her sensitive and brilliant portrayal of Kanchanamala in R.S.Vimal’s debut Ennu Ninte Moideen and as the feisty and go-getting Tessa in Martin Prakat’s Charlie. What is noteworthy is both the roles were poles apart in characterisation. If an ageing Kanchanamala was restrained and inward-looking, boisterous Tessa was anything but reserved or suffering. Both gave Parvathy the chance to showcase her commendable acting skills.\\nEver since she made her debut in 2006 in Out Of Syllabus (2006), Parvathy has consistently worked on her histrionics. Today, one can easily say that she is one of the best in the country. Her films in Tamil and Kannada opposite actors of the likes of Kamal Hassan ( Uttama Villain), Srikanth ( Poo), Dhanush ( Maryan) and Arya ( Bangalore Nattakal) also had her proving her versatility and sincerity as an actor par excellence. As she says in numerous interviews, she does not approach any role, big or small, flippantly. Homework is mandatory and each character is put through a question and answer session by the actor herself. And that is why her characters have made a mark.\\nHowever, Parvathy says that it is expectations that scare her. “It feels great to win the award but then there is also the added pressure,” she says before signing off, even as telephone calls keep intruding into the conversation.',\n",

Swaminathan as saying that to achieve the target, his country acceding to the Ottawa Convention against mines was going to be a “milestone.”\\nLTTE flouted norms\\nOn the current pace of demining, the Army spokesperson said the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), while setting up mines, did not adhere to internationally-accepted norms and the scattered presence of the mines was one of the reasons for the authorities not being able to complete expeditiously. “Unless we are fully confident, we cannot declare any area free of mines,” he said, adding that the government along with international agencies.\\nTo a query, the Japanese envoy replied that his country had supported demining projects in Cambodia and Afghanistan.',\n",

The point that Mr. Sanders is a better general election candidate is buried in CNN’s own report on the polls.\\nMost commentators, even after they did take note of Mr. Sanders’s presence in the field, have argued that he would not be able to garner independent votes and if he wins the nomination, Democrats will lose the general election.\\nCNN poll bets on Sanders\\nCNN poll match-ups predict the following outcomes that challenge yet another part of the conventional wisdom. Ms. Clinton beats Mr. Trump by eight points but Mr. Sanders beats him by 12 points; Ms. Clinton trails Mr. Rubio by three points whereas Mr. Sanders beats him by eight points; and against Mr. Cruz, Ms. Clinton trails by one point while Mr. Sanders leads by 17 points.\\nMoreover, the Mr. Sanders is the most positively rated of all candidates in the fray.\\nHis campaign rakes in $36 million\\nIn yet another sign of his continuing rise, Mr. Sanders’ campaign raked in $ 36 million in February compared to $54.8 million raised in the previous six months. Mr. Sanders is unlikely do well in Super Tuesday states, but will come out of it with enough money and enthusiasm to fight another day.',\n",

He was executed for killing secular Gov.

However, many Pakistanis, including some in the religious establishment and in legal circles, praised Qadri a sign of the spread of Islamic fundamentalist thought in this South Asian nation.\\nOver 300 such executions\\nPakistan lifted a moratorium on the death penalty after a Taliban school attack in December 2014 and has executed over 300 convicts since then.\\nThe government has also taken measures against extremism, introducing a ban on hate speech, abuse of mosques, as well as media blackout on militant groups.

It was posted online Monday.\\nAccording to the report, Google’s car intended to turn right off a major boulevard when it detected sandbags around a storm drain at the intersection.\\nThe right lane was wide enough to let some cars turn and others go straight, but the Lexus needed to slide to its left within the right lane to get around the obstruction.\\nThe Lexus was going 2 mph (3 kph) when it made the move and its left front struck the right side of the bus, which was going straight at 15 mph (24 kph).\\nThe car’s test driver who under state law must be in the front seat to grab the wheel when needed thought the bus would yield and did not have control before the collision, Google said.\\nWhile the report does not address fault, Google said in a written statement, “We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn’t moved there wouldn’t have been a collision.”\\nChris Urmson, the head of Google’s self-driving car project, said in a brief interview that he believes the Lexus was moving before the bus started to pass.\\n“We saw the bus, we tracked the bus, we thought the bus was going to slow down, we started to pull out, there was some momentum involved,” Urmson told The Associated Press.\\nThe Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority said none of the 15 passengers or the driver of the bus was injured.\\nThe transit agency is reviewing the incident and hasn’t reached any conclusions about liability, spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said in a written statement.\\nThere may never be a legal decision on fault, especially if damage was negligible as both sides indicated it was and neither Google nor the transit authority pushes the case.\\nStill, the collision could be the first time a Google car in autonomous mode caused a crash.\\nGoogle cars have been involved in nearly a dozen collisions in or around Mountain View since starting to test on city streets in the spring of 2014. In most cases, Google’s cars were rear-ended. No one has been seriously injured.\\nGoogle’s written statement called the Feb. 14 collision “a classic example of the negotiation that’s a normal part of driving we’re all trying to predict each other’s movements.”\\nGoogle said its computers have reviewed the incident and engineers changed the software that governs the cars to understand that buses may not be as inclined to yield as other vehicles.\\nJessica Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for California’s DMV, which regulates Google’s testing of about two dozen Lexus SUVs in the state, said agency officials spoke Monday with Google but would have no comment.\\nA critic of Google’s self-driving car efforts said the collision shows the tech giant should be kept from taking onto public streets self-driving prototypes it built without a steering wheel or pedals.\\nGoogle sees that as the next natural step for the technology, and has pressed California’s DMV and federal regulators to authorize cars in which humans have limited means of intervening.\\n“Clearly Google’s robot cars can’t reliably cope with everyday driving situations,” said John M.

       " 'With more endorsements for him, the notion of a Trump vs. GOP contest is less and less valid.\\nSoon after his foe-turned-friend and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie introduced him on Saturday as “the only candidate who can restore the lost glory of America”, Republican front runner Donald Trump touched the topic of the evening. “Let me tell you about that little Marco Rubio”, he said.\\nHe does not want to be nasty to his opponents, Mr. Trump said. It appears that there are only two challengers to him left in the field ahead of the March 1 Super Tuesday when 11 states will have Republican primaries or caucuses – Florida Senator Mr Rubio and Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Ohio Governor John Kasich and surgeon Ben Carson are too low in the race. Many early aspirants, including Mr. Christie, have dropped out of the race.\\nMr. Trump’s is focused on Mr. Rubio – in the next 40 minutes, Mr. Trump would call Mr. Rubio a “clown”, “a frightened puppy”, “a choke artist”, “a lightweight”, “a liar”, and always refers to him as “little”, including in tweets. Caricaturing Mr. Rubio as an inept, nervous, ineffective leader is the centrepiece of Mr. Trump’s strategy these days. He does not spare Mr. Cruz completely, though. “These two are morons. Crooks. Liars…I will tell you in a couple of months who is a bigger liar.” At 5-inch 10’, Mr. Rubio himself is conscious of his height, and his heeled shoes had become a point of media attention earlier in the campaign. So the 6”2’ Mr. Trump is rubbing it in. “This little Marco….when he goes to meet President Putin… He would be soaking in sweat as if he has come out of the swimming pool in his suit.. Putin would think, ‘this is easy pick.’ And it is going to be so,” said Mr. Trump.\\nOn another occasion, Mr. Trump said Mr. Rubio was standing in a “puddle of sweat on the debating stage”, when Mr. Christie went after him. Repeatedly calling his opponent ‘little Marco’, follows a pattern — Jeb Bush could not recover from the “low energy” label that Mr. Trump had stuck on him.\\nMr. Trump has his own logic and his supporters – that are only swelling by the day – understand that easily. Mr. Trump has refused to release his tax returns because the tax authorities are auditing him. The senators – who are coordinating their campaigns to target Mr. Trump – have wondered why Mr. Trump gets audited. Mr. Trump has turned the question on its head and is playing victim now.\\n“Why do I get audited? People who make much more money than me are never audited…,” he says and the crowd agrees. The senators have questioned his business skills and honesty by pointing out how Mr. Trump had bankrupted four of his companies. But his supporters see it differently. “Here is a man who knows business. Even after he lost everything, he has bounced back and built this business empire. That is what America needs today,” said one.\\n‘Trump the liberal’\\n\\nMr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz remind people that Mr. Trump had liberal views on abortion and gay marriage. His supporters see that too differently. Pastor Mark Burns, a television evangelist, certified Mr. Trump’s conservative credentials, thanked god for showing him the right path, and prayed for his election as the President. “Thank god for a man who says it aloud that marriage is between a man and a woman,” the pastor said. “Amen,” the crowd replied in unison. And with more endorsements, the notion of a Trump versus GOP establishment contest is increasingly invalid – Mr Christie was chairman of the Republican Governors Association.\\nThough Mr. Rubio’s insult vocabulary is not as rich, he has been trying to respond in kind, mostly calling Mr. Trump a “con artist”. The latest in the armoury of the senators is Mr. Trump’s refusal to distance himself from an endorsement from white supremacist David Duke. Both senators have condemned Mr. Trump on the issue, and later Mr. Trump tweeted that he “disavowed” Mr. Duke.\\nOf the 11 Super Tuesday states, Texas is the only state where Mr. Trump is trailing, but he assures supporters that he will upset Mr. Cruz there, too. Fearing a defeat in his home state, Mr. Cruz has spent most of the last four days in Texas, venturing out only rarely. Mr. Rubio is trailing in his home state of Florida. “Moreover, these senators cannot continue their bonhomie forever. They are going to attack each other sooner rather than later and that will open up space for us,” says a volunteer at a Kasich town hall.',\n",

This is why the demand is being made for the repeal of the Provincial Councils Act and adherence to the original character of the Amendment.\\nAsked whether New Delhi could make any suggestion to Colombo on the Amendment issue under the given circumstances, Mr. Wigneswaran recalled how Constitutional experts from India got involved in the process of drafting the 13th Amendment.\\nA few days ago, while addressing an event to felicitate 25 students of the Northern Province who pursued higher studies in India under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation, Mr. Wigneswaran had said India alone could get “defect-free federal system.” He clarified that his suggestion was nothing new as he had made this when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka a year ago.\\nTo another question whether it was realistic to expect the new Constitution to be federal, the Chief Minister said there had been a perception among sections of Sinhalese that federalism meant separation.\\nIt was only to allay the apprehension that he took the initiative of organising a workshop recently on federalism with the participation of authorities from Switzerland. He explained how federal features were part of the constitutional schemes in several countries such as India, U.S., Canada and Switzerland.

While there were many contenders for the best actor award, Dulquer was the dark horse that breasted the tape at the last minute with his memorable role in Martin Prakkat’s film. It’s a first for the actor, who has also made in a mark in Tamil.\\n“I never expected it. It is such a pleasant surprise. It is yet to sink in,” says Dulquer, the elevation evident in his voice. “The sense of accomplishment is all the more because the film has also won awards for the director and the actress as well. So the team as a whole is celebrating,” says Dulquer. He plays the lead role in the film, which completely steers away from the formulaic format of commercial films and yet is a blockbuster that was still running in theatres a week ago. Blending elements of fiction and fantasy, the movie teases the viewers with its joyous and sparkling treatment of the story and the theme. Dulquer plays a modern-day gypsy who sees joy all around him and tries to make others see and feel that optimism.\\nAnd what did his father, Mammootty, have to say about his son’s first award? “Super proud! Uppa is emotional and so very happy. He advised me not to think too much about it but to get on with my work,” says Dulquer. Incidentally, Mammootty, a winner of the award several times over, was in the contention this year also for his sterling performance in Pathemari. Saying that it is one of the best films that he watched last year, Dulquer adds: “It is such a superb movie, one that narrates the story of Kerala.”\\nReverting to his Charlie, Dulquer says that the team was sure about their characters as Martin was clear about his movie and the story.

DiCaprio, greeted with a standing ovation, took the moment to talk about climate change.\\n“Let us not take our planet for granted,” said DiCaprio. “I do not take tonight for granted.”\\nInarritu, whose win meant three straight years of Mexican filmmakers winning best director, was one of the few winners to remark passionately on diversity in his acceptance speech.\\nColour no bar\\n\\n“What a great opportunity for our generation to really liberate ourselves from all prejudice and this tribal thinking and to make sure for once and forever that the colour of our skin becomes as irrelevant as the length of our hair,” said Inarritu.\\nThe night’s most-awarded film, however, went to neither Spotlight nor The Revenant. George Miller’s post-apocalyptic chase film, Mad Max: Fury Road sped away with six awards in technical categories for editing, makeup, production design, sound editing, sound mixing and costume design.\\n“Us Mad Maxes are doing OK tonight,” said editor Margaret Sixel, who’s married to Miller. The flurry of wins brought a parade of Australian craftsmen onstage in an Oscars that was at least internationally diverse.\\nGasps went around the Dolby when Mark Rylance won best supporting actor over Sylvester Stallone. Nominated a second time for role of Rocky Balboa 39 years later, Stallone had been expected to win his first acting Oscar for the Rocky sequel Creed. But the famed stage actor who co-starred in Steven Spielberg’s Bridge of Spies won instead.\\nAdam McKay and Charles Randolph took best adapted screenplay for their self-described “trauma-dy,” The Big Short, about the mortgage meltdown of 2008. Best known for broader comedies like Anchorman and Step Brothers, McKay gave an election-year warning of the sway of “big money” and “weirdo billionaires” in the presidential campaign.\\nGay pride\\n\\nSam Smith and songwriting partner Jimmy Napes picked up the Academy Award for best song for ‘Writing’s on the Wall’, from the James Bond film Spectre.\\n“I stand here tonight as a proud gay man and I hope we can all stand together as equals one day,” said Smith.\\nHungary scored its second best foreign language Oscar for Laszlo Nemes’ Son of Saul, a harrowing drama set within a concentration camp.\\n“Even in the darkest hours of mankind, there might be a voice within us that allows us to remain human,” said Nemes. “That’s the hope of this film.”\\nProtests outside\\n\\nDown the street from the Dolby Theatre, civil rights activist Al Sharpton led several dozen demonstrators in protest against a second straight year of all-white acting nominees. “This will be the last night of an all-white Oscars,” Sharpton vowed.\\nSeveral top African American film-makers, Ryan Coogler ( Creed) and Ava DuVernay ( Selma) spent the evening not at the Oscars but in the city of Flint in Michigan, raising money for the water-contaminated city.\\nIn a quick response to the growing crisis over lack of diversity, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, led reforms to diversify the Academy’s overwhelming white and male membership. But those changes precipitated a backlash, too. A chorus of Academy members challenged the reforms.\\nBoone Isaacs strongly defended the changes, quoting Martin Luther King Jr. and urging each Oscar attendee to bring greater opportunity to the industry. She was received politely, if not enthusiastically, by the audience.\\n“It’s not enough to listen and agree,” said Boone Isaacs. “We must take action.”',\n",
