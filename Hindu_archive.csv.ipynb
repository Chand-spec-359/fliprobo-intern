       "['Jacklene S. is a single parent of an 11-year-old. While the outbreak of COVID-19 turned life upside down for most people, for her, as the mother of a special child, it meant taking some desperate measures.\\nHer son, Joshua Vivan, is a non-verbal autistic child. Ms. Jacklene used to work as a teacher and drop him off at a special school before going to work, and pick him up later. But the pandemic meant that she remained out of work and unpaid as there was no provision for online classes in her school.\\n“It became very difficult for me as I couldn’t manage him at home. He became very aggressive, tearing clothes and hitting me. I could not control him as he was not ready to be at home,” she said.\\nWith money running out, she took up a marketing job. With no external support, she started changing her child’s routine to sleep during the day, so she could step out for work, and return in time for his online classes.\\n“The special school gave him a tab and started an hour’s class in the evening. After that, he has started enjoying it,” she said.\\nDisruption in the academic year may be a big worry for mainstream school students, but for special children as well as their parents, it has meant the abrupt loss of a big support system in the form of special schools.\\nSarbani Mallick, founder-director, Bubbles Centre for Autism, said, “Online classes has pushed them further into a comfort zone, which is conducive for them, but the social skill component is something which is not getting addressed at all. What about the social inclusion that we have been working on for years? It has gone out of the window.”\\nShe highlighted two crucial issues in the current system: the lack of digital access among many of these children, as well as the burnout of parents. The former has led to dropouts, she said.\\nShobha Sundar, Programme Director, OPD Services, Spastics Society of Karnataka said children with cerebral palsy and intellectual disability would prefer going to school, as keeping them engaged is a major challenge. “Going out, a change of place, getting fresh air – all of this is not happening. They are cooped up at home, and the demand on parents is huge,” she said.\\nOnline classes also require a lot of creativity from special educators, she said. “Our teams and volunteers are finding ways to keep them interested. But there is some fatigue with online, and we are not doing it with very young children – below the age of six. We are giving programmes and tips to parents to keep them engaged through activities. But the children are missing out on physical therapy. The therapist is substituting it with an exercise online,” she explained, adding however that the tempo in participation from the lockdown days is coming down.\\nPreparing for reopening, the school has been training students to wear masks from the initial days. Services such as assessment and therapy have partially opened with adequate measures and individual sessions while the clinic has partially opened for visits, she said.',\n",
       " 'After a delay of several months, work on the long-pending redevelopment of Cubbon Park and transformation of Shivajinagar bus station into a multi-mode transport hub has begun. Both the projects – under the Smart Cities Mission – were slated to begin early this year but had to be postponed due to the lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\\nBengaluru Smart City Limited (BSCL) Managing Director Hephsiba R. Korlapati said that the Shivajinagar bus station project will be completed by March 2021. “The existing pedestrian subway at the Shivajinagar bus station will be revamped and it will be connected with the upcoming metro terminal. The revamp of the subway will include proper ventilation, lighting and fire safety facilities, and signages,” she said.\\nThe metro terminal next to Shivajinagar bus station is being constructed under Phase II of Namma Metro, connecting the 13.9-km underground line from Jayanagar Fire Station to Nagawara. Other facilities include children and senior citizen friendly waiting lounge, information kiosk and toilets.\\nLakes and ponds to be rejuvenated\\nThe redevelopment of Cubbon Park will be carried out in two phases. A senior official of BSCL said that the work will mainly concentrate on rejuvenation of ponds inside Cubbon Park, fixing the damaged fencing, and improvement of pathways.\\nHowever, the plan has not gone down well with many environmentalists and citizens. Officials insisted that the park will not be affected.\\n“We will only repair or improve the existing pathways, and add only where necessary. The cycle track and jogging track have been designed on the existing road network,” said a senior BSCL official.\\nAs a part of water management, Lotus Pond and Karagada Kunte will be rejuvenated. “Pathways around the water bodies and development of adjoining nalas and increasing the carrying capacities of the water bodies by desilting them will also be done,” Ms. Korlapati said, adding that more channels will be added for uninterrupted flow of water. As a part of waste management, a bio-gas plant will be installed.\\nThe project has been planned keeping in mind the needs of senior citizens and children. “Single-use toilets for visually impaired and differently-abled persons have been planned,” she said.',\n",

The former mayor is named as an accused in the chargesheet.\\nAccording to CCB officials, neither Mr. Raj nor his family members can be traced. “Their mobile phones are switched off,” said an official, who is part of the team.\\nThe police are awaiting a response from the hospital that discharged Mr. Raj without alerting them. “We had issued a notice to the hospital administration intimating that they need to inform the CCB prior to discharging the accused. However, they failed to do so,” said the official.\\nOn Friday, the police learned that Mr. Raj had been discharged on October 14.\\nThe incident has caused much embarrassment to the CCB. According to sources, no personnel had been deployed either at the hospital or at his house to keep tabs on the former mayor.\\nPolice Commissioner Kamal Pant said, “We will ensure that he is traced, and necessary action will be taken.”',\n",
       " 'The State on Saturday reported 3,014 new cases taking the total number of cases to 8,23,412. With this, the day’s Test Positivity Rate (TPR) reduced to 2.96%, for the first time after the pandemic peaked in July.\\nThe TPR, which stood at an average of 3.5% in the last seven days, has been dipping since then. From 4.75% in the beginning of this week (October 26), the daily TPR fell to 3.47% on Friday and further reduced to 2.96% on Saturday. The State’s cumulative TPR is currently 10.41%.\\nFrom 6.76% on June 27, the State’s daily TPR saw a drastic jump to 11.2% in over a month’s time (on July 29). TPR hovered between 11% and 18% for a long time before it reduced to 13% in September. It further reduced in October and stood at 9.53 % on October 11. From then onwards, the TPR has been on a decline consistently.\\nTPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. While cumulative positivity rate takes into account all the people tested so far, the daily rate is for those tested on a particular day.\\nPointing out that the low TPR may be due to weekend effect, Giridhar R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said, “We need to wait and check for further drop in seven-day averages. There needs to be a better testing strategy in districts other than Bengaluru so that their testing rates are similar to that of Bengaluru. This is to get a realistic sense of the decreasing TPR,” he said.\\nDecline in deaths too\\nThe State has also been witnessing a decline in fatalities since the beginning of October. From 1.4% on October 29, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) decreased to 0.92% on Saturday with 28 new deaths. With this, the toll rose to 11,168. This is apart from 19 non-COVID-19 deaths.\\nAs many as 7,468 persons were discharged on Saturday taking the total number of recoveries to 7,57,208. Of the remaining 55,017 active cases, 956 patients are being monitored in ICUs.\\nBengaluru Urban reported 1,621 cases taking the tally to 3,36,469.

If residents have any information on fraudsters, they can directly contact the police at 8754401111, and pass on the information. The identity of the informant will be kept confidential, he said.\\nOn Thursday, a 45-year-old woman from Perumbakkam was arrested for allegedly robbing a family in Neelankarai of 102 sovereigns of gold and ₹8 lakh in cash. She had befriended them on the pretext of warding off evil spirits. The suspect, Narayani, was arrested by the police from a hideout.\\nThe victim, Sivakumar, 42, works at the Chennai harbour and is a resident of Palavakkam. His wife died in April, 2018, after her sari allegedly caught fire while she was cooking. Ms. Nayarani met Mr. Sivakumar and his daughter, while she was visiting her daughter, who is their neighbour. She convinced Mr. Sivakumar that his wife died due to evil spirits, and only a special puja could ward them off.\\nShe collected 102 sovereigns of jewellery and ₹8.6 lakh in cash from him for the puja. She reportedly told him that they should perform poojas, for a year, at her house. Only after a year did Mr. Sivakumar realise that he was being cheated. When he demanded that the jewellery be returned, she went absconding.\\nOn his complaint, the police also arrested a pawn broker, Rathanlal, 52, who had bought the jewellery from Ms. Narayani, and had later sold it off. A senior police officer said, “We suspect the woman has cheated others too, in a similar manner.”\\nAnother case\\nLast week, the New Washermenpet police busted a gang of four suspects that cheated several persons on the pretext of performing special pujas to ward off evil spirits. The main suspect was identified as Yuvaraj, 42, from Tiruvallur district. He is yet to be arrested.\\nHe had visited Meenatchipuram, the native of K. Rajakumaran, 45, a mini-truck owner in Tenkasi district, and had convinced him that his family was affected by evil spirits. As per the suspect’s instructions, the victim sold off his mini-truck for ₹5 lakh, and reached Chennai, along with his father-in-law, carrying ₹2 lakh in cash and two roosters. The gang collected the money and the roosters from him near the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, on the pretext of preparing for the puja, leaving the victim in the lurch.\\nA senior police officer said the main suspect engaged his associates to scout for potential victims. Based on the information shared by them, he would personally visit the families, pretending to be god-sent. He would offer to ward off evil spirits, on payment of money and being given roosters for puja. “We suspect the gang has cheated several people,” the officer said.',\n",

Roy Rozario, an office-bearer of the Railway Passengers’ Association, Pattabhiram, and a retired official of the Southern Railway, said suburban train services were the lifeline for thousands of office-goers and daily wage earners, travelling from places like Arakkonam, Tiruvallur and Thiruninravur to the city, and the absence of the trains was burning a hole in their pockets.

This concept is only now catching up in the western world, but was integral to the lives of those of us in India who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s.\\nIn school, we used to approach senior students after the annual examination to buy their textbooks. At home, the books of the older siblings were kept carefully for the younger ones. If anything was unavailable, a visit to the used book store usually helped.\\nThese days, most schools sell textbooks and notebooks for pricey sums. Children think it is below their dignity to buy used books. We even used to tear the unused sheets of our notebooks to use them for rough notes. Now all notebooks go to the scrap dealer. Much to my chagrin, I found that there were no takers for textbooks either. A used book shop told me that the syllabus keeps changing and hence there are no buyers for used books.\\nOur generation grew up in an India where people had limited resources. It was fun to be the eldest child as the younger ones got only hand-me-downs, except on their birthdays and for major festivals.\\nOn birthdays, gifts were recycled and we would not mind it.

The parties are no longer simple affairs. It is as arduous as arranging a wedding.\\nBack then, children walked, cycled or went by school bus to school. Now, many children are dropped off in chauffeur-driven fancy cars. Many of these children, however, stand around holding placards with the message “Save the environment”. From a frugal society, we have become a consumerist society driven by advertisements. The modern mantra is “buy”. Saving, recycling and repairing are alien to the present generation.

On the other hand, the cultural and lifestyle changes that the new economic model ushered in had in one way left a stark question on whether the changes had come for good.\\nWhen we were busy exploring the new-found excitement of sending instant messages and keeping in touch, our parents and grandparents were struggling to adapt to these new-age gadgets. When our text messages advanced to short forms such as LOL, ROFL, LMK and NVM, one whole generation struggled to catch up. Nevertheless, we all had our share of fun looking at them struggle at these new but simple things. What we forgot was that we lived in a constantly changing world, and for good or bad, times were about to change.\\nLosing touch\\nNow, in my early thirties, I have started feeling that the generation gap has already started setting in place between my cohort and Generation Z, or Gen Z.\\nI am a little bit averse to the race of keeping pace with the emerging trends and technology and could never even cross the first few rounds in the hit video game Temple Run, getting caught and smashed by the demonic monkey that would come chasing from behind.\\nI could never get my hands on PUBG before it got banned. The lack of this youthful curiosity started casting a doubt on whether I have already started getting old.\\nThe Gen Z, the digital natives immersed in smartphones and social media, is way smarter, and the competitiveness that has set in has always raised the bar on their performance in exams or at any events. The pace with which they can move is difficult for us to catch up like the same way our previous generation found it difficult to catch up with us. So, a laugh at our struggles while juggling to stay relevant with the new generation is due.\\nFar from the virtual\\nWhile preparing our children to keep up with the changing pace, we must not step on, or throw aside, some of the most intuitive aspects of life.\\nSocial media and smartphones should not lead to an alienation from the real world, which is way more beautiful than the seemingly more attractive virtual world.\\nWe ourselves are already so sucked into the magic of smartphones with which we spend most of our day. So, the possibility is so glaring that this new generation can get deeply sucked into the precarious depths of the shiny virtual world.\\nThe only way to have a real life is by binding with nature. No man-made creation can ever match the beauty and awe that nature has to offer. The new generation needs an introduction to nature, away from the bright lights of the screens they are glued into. A meaningful life is possible only when we feel ourselves part of nature, the sky above and the universe so amazing and still incomprehensible and challenging the human ingenuity to explore.\\nashokbbalakrishna@gmail.com',\n",

That’s not what you’re supposed to be worrying about.”\\nMr. Trump made an aggressive play for pivotal Pennsylvania, focusing largely on his white, working-class base.\\nHis first of four scheduled stops in Pennsylvania was in a small town in Bucks County on the eastern edge of the state.\\nRepeating what has become a consistent part of his closing message, Mr. Trump raised baseless concerns about election fraud, pointing specifically at Philadelphia, a city whose large African American population is key to Mr. Biden’s fate in the state.\\n“They say you have to be very, very careful — what happens in Philadelphia,” Mr. Trump charged. “Everybody has to watch.”\\nThe president also railed against a recent Supreme Court ruling that will allow Pennsylvania to count mail ballots received as many as three days after polls close.\\nThe extra time, Mr. Trump alleged without evidence, would allow for fraud and potentially deny him a win in the state. “What’s going on?” he asked during a late afternoon rally in Reading, Pennsylvania.\\n“That was a very disappointing opinion, but I’ve had many disappointing opinions from the Supreme Court.”\\nSeveral studies, including one commissioned by Mr. Trump himself, have failed to uncover any significant examples of election fraud.\\nGood-government advocacy groups are concerned that the President’s repeated calls for his supporters to monitor the polls may lead to widespread voter intimidation.\\nRepublicans are betting that Mr. Trump can win a second term by driving up turnout among his strongest supporters — white, noncollege-educated men and rural voters — while limiting Mr. Biden’s advantage with Blacks and Latinos. Democrats in several swing states worry that voters of colour may not be excited enough about Biden to show up in the numbers they need.\\nIn Michigan, Rep. Dan Kildee, a Democrat who represents the Flint area, said he had been pressing for a couple of months for Biden or Obama to visit the majority Black city where a water crisis that began in 2014 sickened the city’s residents, exposing stark racial inequities.\\n“Showing up matters,” Mr. Kildee said.\\n“The message is important, no question about it. But there’s a message implicit in showing up, especially in Flint. This is a community that has felt left behind many, many times and overlooked many, many times.”\\nR&B legend Stevie Wonder was to perform in Detroit after Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama speak.\\nMr. Biden’s campaign announced it was sending Mr. Obama to Florida and Georgia on Monday. He is the campaign’s most valuable asset to help energize the nonwhite voters Democrats so badly need to defeat Mr. Trump.\\n“Joe Biden is my brother. I love Joe Biden, and he will be a great President,” Mr. Obama said Saturday.\\nThe press for Michigan’s Black voters comes after voting was down roughly 15% in Flint and Detroit four years ago — a combined 48,000-plus votes in a State Mr. Trump carried by about 10,700 votes.\\nOverall, the Black voter turnout rate declined for the first time in 20 years in a Presidential election, falling to 59.6% in 2016 after reaching a record-high 66.6% four years earlier, according to the Pew Research Center.\\nMr. Trump isn’t ceding Michigan to Mr. Biden.\\nHe visited Waterford Township, near Detroit, on Friday and held a rally in the state capital, Lansing, this past week, though the surging coronavirus cases are clouding his presidency.\\nThe worst week of the year, in terms of new infections, arrived with Election Day looming.\\nMore than 99,000 Americans reported new infections on Friday, a record high, according to Johns Hopkins University.\\nMr. Trump told Pennsylvania voters that his administration has done “an incredible job” dealing with the pandemic.\\nHe promised that the mass distribution of a vaccine was “just weeks away.”',\n",

He says the party has chalked out constituency-focused blueprints for the contest.\\nIn the 2018 Assembly election, you got a resounding majority, especially in the Gwalior-Chambal region. So, what has changed since that election?\\nHistorically, the Congress has never crossed the figure of 18 seats [of the total 34] in the region since Independence. And for the first time in 2018, owing to multiple reasons, we crossed 18 and the tally went up to 26. One seat went to the BSP and seven to the BJP. It was a one-way street for the Congress. That in a huge way resulted in the formation of the Congress government. The party’s victory can largely be attributed to trust reposed in the Congress by the people of Gwalior-Chambal.\\nAlso read: Madhya Pradesh govt reduced employees’ retirement age, says Kamal Nath; CM Chouhan calls it ‘rumour’\\nHaving said that, lawmakers were trampled upon, disrespected and their wishes and aspirations with regard to developmental projects were completely cast aside, combined with a corrupt government of Kamal Nath. Not only me, but two former Ministers of the Congress government, still with the party, said the same thing whilst they were Cabinet Ministers. Never before have Cabinet Ministers of a government written and spoken against the functioning of their government in such an open manner.\\nNevertheless, nothing changed. It’s rather sad and devastating that in a government formed after 15 years, Mr. Nath lost the trust of 22 legislators, of which 16 were MLAs and six Ministers. This is unprecedented in the political discourse of our country. Four legislators resigned later. So, 26 legislators resigning from a political party which possesses only 114 MLAs is a staggering 28 per cent. What kind of government was Mr. Nath running, which could not even hold together its own MLAs let aside cater to the needs of the party’s workers and the public? These facts speak for themselves.\\nWhat are the focus areas of your election strategy this time?\\nWe’ve been in power for six months in Madhya Pradesh and had to battle COVID-19. But we’ve had a clear blueprint in place. First, State-wide measures such as a supplement to the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi in the form of the CM Kisan Samman Nidhi which adds ₹4,000 to ₹6,000 a year to farmers and the delivery of ₹7,500 crores, which Mr. Nath had locked up in his treasury, into farmers’ accounts. Then, resumption of schemes that were scrapped by Mr. Nath such as Ladli Lakshmi and Kanyadan Yojana, and the Sambal scheme. We’ve had a constituency-focused plan in place too wherein developmental requirements not fulfilled by the Congress government have been identified. Every constituency has got between ₹200-300 crore and ₹2,000 crore in development projects. We are going to the people with a blueprint for the State.\\nAlso read: Madhya Pradesh byelections | EC grounds Imarti Devi for a day\\nLet’s not forget, of the 28 seats up for election, 27 belonged to the Congress.

Many people prefer to adopt a girl child,” he said.\\nActivists, however, say more girls are adopted because more of them are available for adoption.\\n“Even a casual visit to an adoption agency will tell you there are far more girls than boys to select for adoption.

       " 'The story so far: On October 27, India and the U.S. signed the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) during the third 2+2 dialogue of defence and foreign ministers of the two countries. This is the fourth and the last of the foundational agreements that both countries have concluded, starting with GSOMIA (General Security of Military Information Agreement) in 2002, LEMOA (Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement) in 2016, COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018, and now BECA.\\nWhat are foundational agreements?\\nThe United States enters into what are called ‘foundational or enabling agreements’ with its defence partners. These agreements govern the nature and scope of U.S. defence partnerships. Partners enhance the capabilities of the U.S. military in distant places through sharing information, platforms and logistics.\\nALSO READ\\nBECA treaty and the long view on India-U.S. talks | The Hindu In Focus podcast\\n The competitive advantage of the U.S. military is maintained primarily by the advanced technologies that the country develops continuously. The U.S. sells military equipment to other countries with strict control over their deployment and use. For instance, consider the B777-300ER aircraft that India bought from Boeing recently for the use of VVIPs. The sale of advanced communication and security systems on the aircraft — which are not commercially available — is made seamless by foundational agreements.\\nThe U.S. is also eager to advance ‘interoperability’ with defence forces of the countries that are its defence partners. Interoperability involves real-time coordination of forces. The U.S. has signed these foundational agreements with at least 100 countries, which mostly follow a standard text. Country-specific changes were made in India’s case in all four foundational agreements.\\nWhat do these agreements do?\\nThe General Security of Military Information Agreement or GSOMIA, and its extension, the Information Security Annex (ISA) signed in 2019, allow military technology cooperation for the sharing of classified information between governments and companies in both countries. The LEMOA enables logistics support, say refuelling of planes or ships, supply of spare parts or maintenance to each other. For instance, U.S. Navy’s P8 aircraft landed in Port Blair last month for refuelling, under LEMOA. Even in the absence of this agreement, such cooperation can and has taken place between India and the U.S., but the agreement makes it seamless, and the accounting easier. The COMCASA allows Indian forces to procure advanced, secure communication equipment from the U.S. Such equipment was earlier denied for U.S. origin platforms such as C-17, C-130, and commercial systems were used in their place. Only after COMCASA was signed were the encrypted systems provided to India.\\nAlso read | Industrial Security Annex opens Indian private partnerships for U.S. defence firms\\nThe BECA enables exchange of geospatial information. Akin to a GPS that enables navigation, such exchange of geospatial information enhances the accuracy of a missile or the utility of a drone.\\nWhat is the strategic importance of these agreements?\\nSince the Civil Nuclear Agreement of 2005, the India-U.S. defence cooperation has been advancing at a rapid pace. The U.S. has relaxed restrictions on technology trade in India’s favour considerably, and India is designated a ‘Major Defence Partner’. Foundational agreements deepen defence cooperation, in trade and operation. India and the U.S. are also part of a broader shared vision for the Indo-Pacific region, where both countries, along with Japan and Australia, are increasing their military cooperation. U.S.-built platforms used by partner countries can talk to one another and share operational information.\\nComment | The India-U.S. defence partnership is deepening\\nAre there any concerns?\\nCritics worry that tying itself too closely with the U.S. may limit India’s choices. The evolution of technology makes it inevitable that all military platforms will be integrated and networked in the future. The U.S. is very particular about the integrity of its networks, and pressure could mount on India to remain firmly in its camp. The U.S. is particularly irked by India’s continuing defence cooperation with Russia. India will be taking the delivery of Russian S-400 missile defence system next year, ignoring American objections. The U.S. could respond with sanctions. At any rate, it will not be possible to integrate Russian and American platforms, and this could throw up new challenges of military planning for India.\\nWatch | India and U.S. sign BECA\\n The moot question, say experts, is whether India could ramp up its defence cooperation with the U.S. without ending up as its ally.',\n",
       " 'The story so far: On October 26, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) announced several amendments to land laws for the Union Territory of Jammu Kashmir (J&K), including the Jammu and Kashmir Development Act of 1970, which till now entitled only permanent residents to purchase or sell property in the former State, and the J&K Land Revenue Act, 1996. The MHA notification said the “Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of Central Laws) Third Order, 2020 shall come into force with immediate effect and will encourage development in the UT of Jammu and Kashmir”. In August 2019, the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and Article 35A was revoked. Section 96 of the J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019 empowers the MHA to adapt and modify any law by way of repeal or amendment before the expiration of one year from the appointed day of the Union Territory of J&K, which is October 31, 2019.\\nWhat are the changes?\\nThe MHA has amended sections of the J&K Land Revenue Act, 1996 and the J&K Development Act of 1970. The 1996 Act pertains to management of agricultural land and the 1970 Act deals with zonal development plans determining land use for public buildings, roads, housing recreation, industry, business, markets, schools, hospitals and public and private open spaces. According to the amendment to the Land Revenue Act, anyone from any part of the country can now buy land in J&K, including agricultural land. Though the amendments prohibit sale, transfer, mortgage and conversion of agricultural land to a non-agriculturist in the UT, it can still be allowed, “provided that the Government or an officer authorized by it in this behalf may grant permission to an agriculturist to alienate the land to a non-agriculturist by way of sale, gift, exchange or mortgage”.\\nAlso read | Changes in J&K land laws: Hurriyat shutdown disrupts normal life\\nThe government can allow the transfer of agricultural land to a public trust for charitable work, healthcare, education, industrial or commercial purposes. A Board of Revenue headed by a Financial Commissioner has been constituted and a fresh clause defining “agricultural land” as land which is used or is capable of being used for agriculture and allied activities, including fallow land, has been inserted. The amendment deletes the “permanent resident” provision in the 1970 Act that provided housing sites within the range of 25-30 square metres to permanent residents belonging to “economically weaker section” and “low income groups”. Now, economically deprived people from all parts of the country will be eligible for such housing sites.\\nA fresh provision has been added, by which the government, on the written request of an Army officer not below the rank of a Corps Commander, may declare an area as a “strategic area” for direct operational and training requirements of the armed forces.\\nIt also creates the Jammu and Kashmir Industrial Development Corporation for establishing commercial centres and industries in the UT. The Corporation shall consist of twelve directors, four of whom could be nominated from the private sector with experience in “industry or trade or finance”. The Corporation will have the power to acquire movable and immovable property, and to lease, sell, exchange or transfer any property held by it. If the Corporation is unable to acquire land by an agreement, the government could order proceedings under the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 and acquire the land for “public purpose”. No court can take cognisance relating to property vested in the Corporation, except when the Corporation files a complaint. No legal suit can be filed against officials of the Corporation without a prior notice of two months and not later than six months from the date of complaint.\\nEditorial | Real estate: On changes to J&K land laws\\nWhat amendments have been brought about in government land holdings?\\nThe Jammu and Kashmir Land Grants Act, 1960, which regulates grant of government land on lease and earlier applied to urban areas of Jammu, Srinagar and towns, will now be extended to the entire UT. The amendment omits the permanent resident clause to get government land on lease for “residential purposes”. The J&K Agrarian Reforms Act, 1976, which provided for transfer of land from big land owners to tillers, has been amended. The erstwhile agrarian reforms Act stated that only up to two kanals (0.25 acre) of land could be held per family for residential purposes.\\nAlso read | J&K government declares Roshni Act ‘null and void’\\nWhat about laws for Ladakh?\\nThe main political parties in J&K have questioned the land laws, and say the Centre engaged with Ladakh and not J&K on land laws and job protection. The laws for Ladakh have not yet been notified as local leaders have demanded inclusion in the Sixth Schedule (tribal) of the Constitution to protect their land from “outsiders”.',\n",

Kumaraswamy on Sunday accused the BJP of transporting cash to Sira, even as the Congress released video tapes purportedly showing BJP workers enticing people to vote for their candidate in R.R. Nagar. Despite the results of the bypolls in Sira and R.R. Nagar not having any consequence for the BJP government, the election is being fought tooth and nail.\\n“Voter ID cards have been collected in several places where minorities are high in number, and voters have been given money not to vote by BJP workers. In other places, money is being distributed to vote in favour of the BJP. What is the Election Commission doing?” asked D.K. Suresh, MP for Bengaluru Rural, at a press conference. He also released video clips in support of his claims.\\nIn Sira, addressing a rally, Mr. Kumaraswamy alleged that the ruling BJP had transported to the constituency ₹6 crore in cash using a police vehicle. “A police officer told me, but I do not want to reveal his name,” he said. He accused the BJP of offering more than ₹1,500 to entice voters. “But using money power, the BJP cannot win in Sira, like they won in K.R. Pete,” he added.\\nMeanwhile, former Minister and BJP leader Arvind Limbavali dismissed the allegations and said, “If money is being distributed, the Congress should complain to the Election Commission. Let there be an inquiry.”',\n",

Nagar, said on Sunday that 14 cases have been filed in various police stations in the Assembly segment under the Disaster Management Act for violation of COVID-19 norms. There have also been five cases of poll code violation.\\nHe said those who were not residents of the segment would not be allowed to stay further, now that the public campaigning for the byelection was over. He said that as part of additional arrangements, nine flying squads, apart from the 27 already in place, 36 marshals, five video-viewing teams, 56 sector officers, and eight excise flying squads have been deployed. Extra vigil will be kept on places such as marriage halls and community centres where people can congregate. He reiterated that as per the directions of the Election Commission, exit polls should not be published from November 3 to 7. There is also a ban on sale of liquor till midnight on Tuesday, and also on November 10, the day of vote counting. Prohibitory orders will be in place till Wednesday 6 p.m.\\nPolice Commissioner Kamal Pant said 2,563 police personnel would be deployed for security and bandobast. There have been no untoward incidents so far and local issues have been solved by the jurisdictional police stations, he added.',\n",

       " 'In the midst of allegations of distribution of money to woo voters in Sira and Rajarajeshwarinagar Assembly constituencies, which will go to the polls on Tuesday, the open campaign came to an end on Sunday.\\nWith limited time available at the disposal of leaders, rallies and padayatras marked the day, while party workers went from house to house to solicit votes. While the entire clan of JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda campaigned in different parts of Sira, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president D.K. Shivakumar was in R.R. Nagar. The campaign by city BJP leaders was focused on R.R. Nagar.\\nThe bitter battle for the R.R. Nagar seat between the Congress and the BJP led to tense moments as BJP workers staged a protest early on Sunday morning on ring road, on their way to Nandini Layout police to register a complaint against the Congress for a skirmish with saffron party workers. Revenue Minister R. Ashok took out padayatra on behalf of the party’s candidate, Munirathna, and participated in a rally too.\\nMr. Shivakumar was also in R.R. Nagar. Later in the day, MP for Bengaluru Rural D.K. Suresh denied that the Congress was involved in any untoward incident. He criticised the BJP for “enacting a drama” to gain sympathy.\\nIn Sira, the JD(S), which is fighting to retain the seat, staged a huge road show and rally to mark the end of its campaign. While former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy and his son Nikhil participated in the road show, former Minister H.D. Revanna and his son, and MP for Hassan, Prajwal Revanna also joined in. At a massive rally, Mr. Deve Gowda announced that he would adopt Sira taluk for development and sought votes to “protect the party”.\\nAmmajamma blacks out\\nAmmajamma, the JD(S) candidate in Sira, blacked out during the campaign rally owing to exhaustion on Sunday. The 61-year-old, who had just recovered from COVID-19, took part in the party’s campaign rally in the morning. She almost fainted, but party workers came to her rescue. Sources in the JD(S) said she had been taking part in the campaign despite her tiredness. Ms. Ammajamma also made a fervent appeal to voters, seeking support on the basis of the party’s contribution to the constituency.',\n",
       " '“When residents of the bypoll-bound R.R. Nagar in Bengaluru suffered house damage after heavy rains, they got an immediate relief of ₹25,000 per household. But such relief was missing for North Karnataka,” said farmers’ leader Choonappa Pujari in Belagavi on Sunday. He accused the State government of playing politics over flood relief.\\nThe farmers of Belagavi have been badly hit by successive floods and are finding it difficult to rebuild their lives. Farmers in Kangrali in Khanapur taluk have lost three crops since the monsoon of 2019 and also suffered losses in the recent heavy rains. Basavaraj Kareppa, who had sown millets, niger and vegetables on his 4-acre land, said his entire crop was washed away. “I lost my crop in 2019. I reinvested all the money that I received in relief on cultivation of kharif crop this time. But I have lost that too,” he said.\\nHe is among the many farmers and villagers who have lost their crops, houses and cattle. Very few have got proper relief amounts, according to Jayashree Gurannanavar, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) leader. She alleged that only the politically powerful farmers had got proper compensation.\\nThe KRRS conducted a house loss survey in Saundatti taluk and found that 6-8 houses were damaged in each village, but the staff at the tahsildar’s office have maintained that only 35 houses were damaged in the taluk, she said. Mr. Pujari alleged that families with clout had bribed or influenced officers to include their names in the list of house collapse victims, despite not suffering the misfortune.\\nCompensation numbers\\nOfficials admitted that only a handful of the 4,619 families who lost their houses have received complete compensation in Belagavi district. The Rajiv Gandhi Rural Housing Corporation releases house loss relief in four instalments. Only a small percentage of individuals have got the fourth instalment. At a recent review meeting, officers told Revenue Minister R. Ashok that only around 20% of the beneficiaries had received three instalments. Over 80% are yet to get the second instalment, which is given for building walls after laying the foundation of the house. The official reason is that the beneficiaries have not been quick to upload the GPS data on the house sites and pictures of the various stages of house construction.\\nHowever, the impact of this year’s floods has been less than that of last year’s. Officials have estimated the loss suffered by private individuals, government institutions and public authorities to be ₹268 crore between July to September. The loss in October is still being assessed. Officials say that may come to around another ₹100 crore to ₹150 crore. But this is much lower than the losses suffered in 2019. The loss in Belagavi district alone stood at around ₹35,000 crore then, said a senior officer. Of that, only around 6%, or ₹2,100 crore, was released by the Union government last year.\\nIn Vijayapura district, the total crop loss is around ₹790 crore, and over 3,000 houses have been affected. Ex-gratia relief has been given to 1,325 families who lost their houses. Initial estimates have put crop loss on 2.5 lakh hectares, including 15,000 hectares of horticultural crop. This translates to an input subsidy relief of ₹636 crore for agriculture and ₹156 crore for horticulture. The final survey is yet to be completed.\\nIn Bagalkot, as many as 5,881 houses were completely or partially damaged. The crop loss is pegged at one lakh hectares of agricultural crop and 47,000 hectares of horticultural crop. The total loss is estimated to be around ₹700 crore. In both Bagalkot and Vijayapura, distribution of crop loss relief is in progress, while house damage compensation distribution is yet to start.\\nWhat was promised\\nThere is palpable anger over the delay in distribution of compensation across these districts. After conducting an aerial survey of flood-hit areas in Kalaburagi and Yadgir on October 21, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa had promised that relief and rehabilitation work would be taken up on a war footing. The next day, Deputy Chief Minister and Kalaburagi district in-charge Govind Karjol reiterated this. He promised an immediate relief of ₹10,000 to each flood-affected family and a survey of damaged houses within 15 days. Over a week down the line, these assurances are yet to translate into reality.',\n",
       " 'Residents of Halebidu in Belur staged a protest on Sunday morning opposing the release of water from Dorasamudra tank. Officers of the Water Resources Department had let the water out to repair the tank bund.\\nThe protesters maintained that the officers had assured them they would repair the bund without wasting any water from the tank that had been filled for the first time in the last 15 years.\\nThe protesters raised slogans against the officers and Belur MLA K.S. Lingesh. They alleged that the release of water would damage the area downstream. Somashekhar Shivacharya Swami of Pushpagiri Mutt and others visited the spot extending support to the protest. Senior police officers and Revenue Department officials also were present.\\nLater in the afternoon, K. Gopalaiah, Minister for Food and Civil Supplies and Minister in charge of the district, visited the spot and spoke to protesters. He said the officers had released water only to take up the work. “It is the responsibility of the officers to ensure the safety of the people. If it rains heavily and the tank bund collapses, it would cause serious damage. There is sufficient water in the tank and there is no need to worry,” he said. He also told the protesters that the repair work would be completed within 10 days and the water level would be maintained.',\n",

A spacious office was provided for it in the building of the National Centre for History of Science at Manasagangotri. Experts and littérateurs who graced the virtual event to mark the occasion and celebrate the Kannada Rajyotsava, laid the broad contours and the work that needs to be undertaken on priority.\\nJnanpith awardee and Kannada littérateur Chandrashekar Kambar who made a virtual address said Indian languages have a hoary past and a wealth of literature but English has usurped the position of a link language due to the education system introduced by the British. This system introduced by Macaulay bred an inferiority complex among Indians who have come to consider their past as worthless. The situation is such that it is considered a must for jobs today and the language experts and CESCK should strive to ensure that Kannada regains its pride of place, said Mr. Kambar.\\nHe said there was no country as linguistically diverse as India with a wealth of literary corpus and the Bhakti movement opened the floodgates of literary outpouring. Yet English was encouraged as it was linked to job opportunities whereas this was not so in countries like China, Russia or Japan.\\nG. Hemantha Kumar, Vice-Chancellor, University of Mysore, described the shifting of the CESCK to Mansagangotri campus as a sort of ‘homecoming’ and laid the broad road map for the centre apart from its research activities. He said works of poets like Pampa, Ranna, Ponna, etc., should be translated into English and other Indian languages. There was no dearth of Kannada scholars but efforts should be made to identify senior most scholars and document and recognise their works, he added.\\nDeputy Director of Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) Umarani Kuppaswamy said there were nearly 43 million Kannada speakers in the country constituting 3.61% of the population. The language had rich traditions spanning over 2,000 years. She said culture and language were interlinked and celebrating a language amounted to celebrating a culture and if the language was lost the culture too would perish with it. She said the CIIL can help in promoting Kannada as a link language among tribes some of who had their own languages but did not have a script.',\n",

The first stage of the Pallivasal hydro-electric project was completed in 1940 and, by 1952, it became full-fledged with a total installed capacity of 37.5 MW.

He had used the shade of power to amass wealth illegitimately. His brother, Binoy, had attempted to browbeat ED officers in Bengaluru, he alleged. BJP State president K. Surendran said the CPI(M) central leadership was funded by its Kerala unit. CPI(M) was in its last throes in West Bengal. It never had a pan-India presence. The CPI(M) in New Delhi required funds from Kerala to survive.\\nMr. Surendran asked the Kerala Cricket Association to expel Bineesh. He said some office-bearers in the KCA had financial links with Bineesh. Hence, they were compelled to protect him. Mr. Surendran said Bineesh had used the heft of his father’s political office to wrest the control of the KCA from genuine cricketers. The UDF government also turned a blind eye to the corruption in the KCA headed by a faction led by T.C. Mathew, Mr. Surendran alleged.\\nThe BJP also demanded an inquiry by the ED into Bineesh’s “investments and partners” in the entertainment and cinema industry. Some cinema producers were frontmen for Bineesh’s illegal operations. Mr. Surendran said the UDF government had glossed over criminal cases registered against Bineesh.',\n",

       " 'A road laid by the Forest Department with heavy machinery inside the core, inviolate habitats of the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR) in Tirunelveli district could endanger its very existence, activists say.\\nWhile KMTR officials insist that they were only clearing the ‘katcha’ road to have better access for Forest Department officials to the core areas for better surveillance and that no heavy machinery was used, activists point out that for decades, foresters have only travelled by foot and not on jeeps, and this could set off a dangerous trend.\\nPhotographs accessed by The Hindu show that bulldozers are being used to lay the road. The road was being laid in gross violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act and the Wildlife Protection Act. The new road and the resultant vehicular movement could endanger the KMTR’s core and threaten its very survival, and activists have called for a halt to this activity.\\nType-I unit\\nKMTR was declared a tiger reserve in 1988, the first in Tamil Nadu. It has been identified as a Type-I tiger conservation unit representing the tropical moist evergreen forests. It also forms part of the inter-State Agasthiyarmalai Biosphere Reserve, declared one of the plant diversity centres by UNESCO.\\nIt was also declared the Regional Centre of Endemism in the Indian subcontinent. There are 2,255 species of Angiosperms so far recorded from the KMTR, including 448 species endemic to the Western Ghats, in addition to 150 species that are strictly endemic to the Agasthiyarmalai, say researchers working in the reserve.\\nAccording to activists, this core habitat is one of the highly protected areas with the least entry points. One has to cross the Papanasam checkpoint and reach the Mundanthurai plateau and thereon travel to Servalar and the Karaiyar dam inside the core.\\nThe vehicular movement is usually restricted up to the dam, as pucca roads have been laid only up to that. Only 5 kani tribal settlements are present in the core area. There are very few elephant areas in the reserve.\\nAbout 10 years ago, trekking was also stopped. There are only patrolling/combing routes available from the Karaiyar dam to Kalivarpul until recently, which lead to Bomacadu (Kerala border). The forest staff and the anti-poaching watchers were patrolling the forest by foot, say activists.\\nImportantly, activists and researchers said these were the few tropical evergreen patches left in the country, free from any man-made interventions and serving as a water catchment for the perennial Tamirabharani river.\\nAlleging that heavy machinery was being operated now to clear rainforest patch along Karaiyar-Kannikatti-Kalivarpul Mottai for 30 km, the activists say such clearing would amount to loss of biodiversity, encourage a larger vehicular movement and allow easy access to poachers and even Maoist infiltration.\\nAnd for an area that had no road entry, creating a road by clearing the forest inside the core area raises suspicion, they add.\\n“Another reason for laying the road could be to facilitate access for high-profile pilgrims to the Agasthiyar temple in the peak in vehicles. Now they have to trek,” says an activist.\\nKMTR field director Yogesh Singh did not react and said the local officer (a deputy director) would answer. KMTR deputy director (Ambasamudram division) Kommu Omkaram denied that heavy equipment was used to lay roads in the core zone between the Papanasam dam and Kalibar Pullmottai. The 30-km ‘katcha’ road connecting the border with Kerala through the dense jungle would usually be maintained to ensure the movement of the vehicles of KMTR officials to reach the spots within the shortest possible time.\\n“Since this area would witness heavy winds throughout the year, uprooting of huge trees is quite usual, and would make our travel inside the core zone tougher. Even then we don’t lay ‘pucca roads’ in this area fearing that it would encourage the entry of outsiders. We used to remove only periodically the wild growth that would cover the ‘katcha’ roads,” he said.\\nA retired forest official, a native of the region, said forest officials should continue to trek the region and not lay new roads for them to travel in jeeps. The road plan should be immediately abandoned. Initially, forest officials would only say they would travel on the route. Then the political pressure would make them open up the road for more people. Eventually, there would be a demand for the road to connect to Kerala. This road threatens the very existence of KMTR, he warned.',\n",

       " 'The name ‘Tondaradipodi’ is eponymous of the inherent nature of this Azhwar which is to serve the bhagavatas and bhaktas of God. Though his original name is Vipranarayana, this name has come to stay. ‘Tondar’ is a devotee and servant of God, ‘adi’ is the feet of the devotee and ‘podi’ is the dust from the devotee’s feet. The swabhava which makes one respectful to not only God but to show the same respect to all His devotees is central to bhagavata dharma, pointed out Sri A.K. Sundarrajan in a discourse. This bhava that sees no difference between serving God or His devotees takes root in one who has internalised the truth that the Lord is equally present in all aspects of the entire creation that includes the ‘chit’ and the ‘achit.’\\nTondaradipodi Azhwar’s life and his two famous hymns, the Tirumaalai and the Tirupalliyezhuchi, show his eagerness to make all jivatmas devotees of God. In the Tirumaalai, he alternates between the mode of self talk and direct conversation with Lord Ranganatha. For instance, he explains in a hymn how all beings endowed with the jnanendriyas, karmendriyas and a mind are not able to see this as God’s gift to them to be used to realise Him. Instead, they get involved in worldly matters and are caught deep in samsara. They only seek to be born in this world while the chance to realise God is available if only they can at least chant the name ‘Ranga’ or Srirangam. This Divya Kshetra is the residence of the Supreme Lord of Vaikunta, the Jagat Rakshaka, and the sole cause of all existence. Proficiency in the sastras may have its own value, but does not guarantee realisation. But the state of God realisation, jnana, is possible only by the grace of the Lord, says Azhwar as he himself has experienced it in his own life.',\n",

Some doctors at the MCH pointed out that the situation here might not be that bad, but inadequate deployment of nursing staff was a cause for concern.\\nRight now, there are two intensive care unit wards marked exclusively for COVID care. However, only three nurses have been allotted for a 15-bed ward at a time, that is, one nurse for five patients. “Neither the nursing staff nor the hospital authorities can be blamed for this situation. It is a systemic problem. The staff pattern needs to be revised in line with the existing circumstances,” they pointed out.\\nAlso, doctors and nurses from all departments are being allotted COVID-19 duty. At least some of them may not be trained in attending to infected persons or those in need of critical care at the ICU units. This could create issues in certain cases, a doctor said.\\nRenal patients\\nSources pointed out that MCH remained the only government hospital in the district where infected persons were given dialysis facility.

       " 'You may have watched the ‘Mutual Fund Sahi Hai’ investor initiatives that attempt to spread awareness about mutual funds. One such initiative suggests you should buy overnight funds as ‘net practice’ before investing in other (read equity) funds.\\nHere, we discuss why you cannot get ‘net practice’ for investing to achieve your goals.\\nRoutine versus non-routine\\nLike most individuals, you may be good at grocery shopping, typically grabbing a discount when you see one. But there is a reason why your skill at grocery shopping cannot be replicated in your investment decisions.\\nWe are typically good at taking decisions for routine issues because good decision-making comes out of experience. And, experience comes from learning (including taking bad decisions). So, if you buy groceries every fortnight and make bad decisions (buying a day or two before the store offers discounts), you can eventually understand the store’s discount policy and accordingly adjust your future purchases.\\nUnfortunately, it is not often that you buy a house.\\nAnd, you retire only once. You may rightly point out that all of us pursue several goals during our lifetime. Suppose you are investing to achieve two goals — buying a house five years hence and funding your child’s education with a 10-year horizon. Also, suppose you make mistakes in managing down payment-for the house. Can you learn from these mistakes and manage your child’s education portfolio better? Not necessarily. Why?\\nNot all goals you pursue at any point in time will have the same priority. For instance, funding your child’s education portfolio may be more important than buying a house. So, the risk you are willing to take and, therefore, your choice of investment products to achieve high-priority goals, will be different compared to your choice of products for low-priority goals.\\nOf course, this does not mean that you cannot learn from your investment experience. But, you have to appreciate that no two investment experiences will be the same.\\nThere is another way to convince yourself to invest in equity funds. Suppose you decide to invest only in bank fixed deposits to achieve a life goal. Imagine the amount of money you have to save every month, given that your post-tax return on bank deposits is less than 4%.\\nHigher savings, an option?\\nWould you like to cut your current consumption and save more? Or, do you want to stick with current consumption and invest in high-expected-return-investments such as equity funds? From a behavioural perspective, cutting your current consumption is more painful than the likelihood of suffering losses on your equity investments in the future.\\nAlso, there is a possibility of regret if you do not save enough to achieve your life goal.\\nSo, think of investing in equity funds as a requirement to achieving your goal. To test the waters, you could, perhaps, invest in index funds before you are ready to invest in active funds. Finally, remember this: you (typically) only invest once for each life goal.\\n(The author offers training programmes for individuals to manage their personal investments)',\n",

As the sun slowly set over the Afghan capital, there were few other details though the Taliban issued a statement denying they took part in the assault.\\nThe attack came as the insurgents are continuing peace talks with the U.S.-backed government. Those negotiations, taking place in the Gulf Arab state of Qatar, aim to help the U.S. finally withdraw from America’s longest war, though daily bloodshed continues and an Islamic State affiliate launches its own attacks on Shiites in the country.\\nFive hours into the fighting, sporadic grenade explosions and automatic weapons fire echoed down the empty streets surrounding the University’s fenced compound. Afghan troops stood guard. Earlier, students were fleeing for their lives from the site.\\n“Unfortunately, there are casualties,” Mr. Arian said as the assault unfolded, without elaborating.\\nAhmad Samim, a university student, said he saw militants armed with pistols and Kalashnikov assault rifles firing at the school, the country’s oldest with some 17,000 students. He said the attack happened at the University’s eastern side where its law and journalism faculty teach.\\nAfghan media reported a book exhibition was being held at the university and attended by a number of dignitaries at the time of the shooting.\\nWhile Afghan officials declined to discuss the book fair, Iran’s semiofficial ISNA news agency reported on November 1 that Iranian Ambassador Bahador Aminian and cultural attachş Mojtaba Noroozi were scheduled to inaugurate the fair, which would host some 40 Iranian publishers. Iranian state television reported the attack occurred, but did not offer information on its officials.\\nIranian diplomats have been targeted previously by attacks in the country and nearly sparked a war between the two countries. In 1998, Iran held the Taliban responsible for the deaths of nine Iranian diplomats who were working in its consulate in northern Afghanistan and sent reinforcements to the 950-kilometre- (580-mile-) long border that Iran and Afghanistan share.\\nNo group immediately took responsibility for the ongoing attack though the Taliban issued a statement saying they were not involved. However, suspicion immediately fell on the Islamic State group.\\nLast month, the Islamic State group sent a suicide bomber into an education centre in the capital’s Shia dominated neighbourhood of Dasht-e-Barchi, killing 24 students and injuring more than 100. The Islamic State affiliate in Afghanistan has declared war on Afghanistan’s minority Shia Muslims and have staged dozens of attacks since emerging in 2014.\\nSchools have been targeted for attacks in the past as well. Last year, a bomb outside of the Kabul University campus’ gates killed eight people. In 2016, gunmen attacked the American University in Kabul, killing 13.\\nViolence has been relentless in Afghanistan even as the Taliban and a government-appointed negotiation team discuss a peace agreement to end more than four decades of war in the country. The talks in Qatar have been painfully slow and despite repeated demands for a reduction in violence, the chaos has continued unabated.\\nA U.S. deal with the Taliban in February set the stage for peace talks currently underway in Doha. The deal also allows for the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO troops from Afghanistan.\\nMeanwhile on November 2, a vehicle hit a roadside mine in the country’s southern Helmand province, killing at least seven civilians, most of them women and children, Provincial Governor spokesman Omer Zwak said.',\n",

Also, since payment of the penalty amount is no more physical, by the time the violator comes to know of the fine, there is some cooling off period.\\nCOVID-19 pandemic has given another excuse for motorcyclists – that wearing a helmet on top of a mask makes breathing and riding difficult, which is being gleefully accepted. On the other hand, police personnel are not inclined to conduct breathalyser tests to check drunken driving as exposure to particulate matter from exhalation of drivers could carry the risk of contracting COVID-19. Almost 1,000 security personnel in Anantapur already got infected and two for the second time after rejoining duties.\\nAccording to Kurnool Traffic Deputy Superintendent of Police Mahaboob Basha most violations come from autorickshaw drivers either in the form of overloading, not wearing the uniform and driving in the wrong direction on one-way carriageways.\\n\"Our concentration is on stopping minors from driving, talking over mobile phones while driving and triple riding, which have become a common behaviour causing a number of accidents. The noise pollution from fancy motorbikes without a silencer is also on the rise and we are determined to curb it at any cost,\" he adds.\\nIn the two and a half months prior to the pandemic, in Kurnool district alone, 400 one-day imprisonments were imposed for drunken driving and one of them sent in a 14-day remand for obstructing/quarreling with police personnel on duty.',\n",
       " 'Implementation of traffic rules and slapping defaulters with fines is a process as labyrinthine as regulating traffic on jammed roads, feel a section of the police and transport department officials in a tri-State border district like Chittoor.\\nAccording to police officials, \"Implementation of the forthcoming rules will be next to impossible at a time when COVID-19 has thoroughly shaken the economy of the middle-class and poorer sections.\"\\nNot having a driving licence for a two-wheeler would invite a penalty of ₹5,000 for a driver and non-holding of an insurance policy attract a fine of ₹10,000 as per the new norms.\\nStudent population\\nIn Chittoor district, with its 40-plus colleges offering professional courses and so many corporate junior colleges with thousands of students, who are still minors, it is common knowledge that driving without a licence is rampant. Also, 80% of the vehicle riders, mostly two-wheelers, avoid renewal of insurance policies.\\n\"Believe it or not, 90% of the girls in the age group of 18-23 have no driving licences, but hit the roads with stylish bikes and cars. When we (police) stop them, they weep like anything, making phone calls to their dads and eventually it leads to political pressure on us,\" says a police officer in a circle bordering with Tamil Nadu.\\nUse of influence\\nRecalling an old case in Kuppam, an officer says a youth was slapped a penalty of ₹5,000 for riding a motorbike (worth ₹38 lakh) without valid documents and a driving licence. As he was ‘the son of an influential sarpanch’ political pressure travelled from Kuppam to Amaravati. With the officer remaining unmoved, a superior had cleared the penalty and the bike landed at the sarpanch’s house in no time. But as fate would have it, sometime later the boy was critically hurt in a road accident. At his request, the officer visited the hospital in Bengaluru and consoled the youth, and accepted the latter’s belated apology. \"When we slap penalty, we value a human life. We just want the public to become aware of the true spirit behind traffic rules,\" the police officer remarks.\\nPoverty\\nMany grama volunteers too come under this category. A 25-year-old volunteer in Nagari laments, \"I do not have a licence and the rickety vehicle I use is not in my name. Hundreds of volunteers are like me. The new penalty of ₹5,000 for driving without a licence, is equal to my monthly honorarium, with which I run a family consisting of a crippled father and aging mother.\" Volunteers could be the worst-hit under the new rules, she fears. On the other hand, some police personnel feel that the hike in penalties will only lead to increased political interference to bail out defaulters.',\n",
       " 'Even as road rage continues to take a heavy toll on people’s lives, with an estimated 1.50 lakh fatalities across the country and nearly 8,000 deaths in the State, the Government of Andhra Pradesh has enhanced compounding fee (CF) for various violations under the Motor Vehicle Act under section 200 and released the gazette notification on October 21.\\nEver since the new CF schedule has been released, it has been much debated but a closer look at the Act answers many doubts.\\nThe MV Act 1988 has prescribed various penal provisions against violations under sections 177 to 199. It may be noted that the intent of the Act is to prosecute the offenders by way of imposing a fine or imprisonment. However, as prosecution is not feasible for all offences on the road, a provision has been made under Section 200 allowing the State governments to compound the offences in lieu of prosecution, which is a time consuming process. However, compounding is not provided for certain offences like drunken driving (Section 185), fatal accidents (Section 187), where the accused are prosecuted in a court of law.\\nThe State governments have the right to fix the amount of CF for various offences through a notification and the last such notification was issued in the year 2011. States like Karnataka, Kerala, Odisha , Gujarat, Assam and Punjab have already revised the CF schedule, while Telangana’s proposal is pending with the government.\\n\"The decision to enhance the compounding fees was long overdue. The Supreme Court committee on Road Safety has been very critical of the State governments which have not revised the compounding fees in tune with the amended Act. The Government of India has also enacted many amendments to the MV Act in the year 2019 and enhanced fines and terms of imprisonment for various offences. Since the quantum of punishment both by levying fines and imprisonment for various violations from Section 177 to Section 199 have been enhanced by new amendments, the State governments have also decided to enhance the compounding fees in tune with the intentions of the amended Act,\" said Additional Transport Commissioner S.A.V. Prasada Rao.\\nA committee set up by the Transport Department to study the various provisions of the amended Act recommended enhancement of compounding fees and a notification was issued vide G.O M.S. No. 21. The CF for each offence has been fixed in such a way that it is in tune with the fine prescribed under relevant sections of the Act. The government has also fixed a range of amounts for violations under various sections.',\n",

If a party owned lands beyond the slab, they had to declare it to the government, under the Act. If the excess lands were sold wholly, or in parts, to another party, the transaction would not be allowed.\\n“This decision will boost the business environment in the State,” the officer said.\\nAnother official in the Revenue Department said the Tamil Nadu government’s decision followed high-level deliberations on the issue and consideration of opinions from the Advocate General in this regard. He, however, clarified: “If the authorised officer has already taken steps to recover the lands to the government, this will not apply. This will only apply to lands pending action by the government.”\\nSo far, the Industrial Exemption Committee had not recommended the grant of permission in case of ‘seller-attracted issue’ lands, and representatives of the Industries Department were of the view that Section 20 of the Land Reforms Act should not be enforced on industrial units, when its seller held land beyond the ceiling limit, but no declaration had been made by the authorised officer for the said land. The issue was discussed in detail during a meeting chaired by the Chief Secretary in March.\\nThe G.O. can be accessed on The Hindu portal at http://bit.ly/TNGOIndustry']"
