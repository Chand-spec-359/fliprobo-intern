       "['Jacklene S. is a single parent of an 11-year-old. While the outbreak of COVID-19 turned life upside down for most people, for her, as the mother of a special child, it meant taking some desperate measures.\\nHer son, Joshua Vivan, is a non-verbal autistic child. Ms. Jacklene used to work as a teacher and drop him off at a special school before going to work, and pick him up later. But the pandemic meant that she remained out of work and unpaid as there was no provision for online classes in her school.\\n“It became very difficult for me as I couldn’t manage him at home. He became very aggressive, tearing clothes and hitting me. I could not control him as he was not ready to be at home,” she said.\\nWith money running out, she took up a marketing job. With no external support, she started changing her child’s routine to sleep during the day, so she could step out for work, and return in time for his online classes.\\n“The special school gave him a tab and started an hour’s class in the evening. After that, he has started enjoying it,” she said.\\nDisruption in the academic year may be a big worry for mainstream school students, but for special children as well as their parents, it has meant the abrupt loss of a big support system in the form of special schools.\\nSarbani Mallick, founder-director, Bubbles Centre for Autism, said, “Online classes has pushed them further into a comfort zone, which is conducive for them, but the social skill component is something which is not getting addressed at all. What about the social inclusion that we have been working on for years? It has gone out of the window.”\\nShe highlighted two crucial issues in the current system: the lack of digital access among many of these children, as well as the burnout of parents. The former has led to dropouts, she said.\\nShobha Sundar, Programme Director, OPD Services, Spastics Society of Karnataka said children with cerebral palsy and intellectual disability would prefer going to school, as keeping them engaged is a major challenge. “Going out, a change of place, getting fresh air – all of this is not happening. They are cooped up at home, and the demand on parents is huge,” she said.\\nOnline classes also require a lot of creativity from special educators, she said. “Our teams and volunteers are finding ways to keep them interested. But there is some fatigue with online, and we are not doing it with very young children – below the age of six. We are giving programmes and tips to parents to keep them engaged through activities. But the children are missing out on physical therapy. The therapist is substituting it with an exercise online,” she explained, adding however that the tempo in participation from the lockdown days is coming down.\\nPreparing for reopening, the school has been training students to wear masks from the initial days. Services such as assessment and therapy have partially opened with adequate measures and individual sessions while the clinic has partially opened for visits, she said.',\n",
       " 'Four pedestrians were injured when the driver of a private bus lost control of the vehicle and ploughed into a hotel on 2nd Main Road, Vyalikaval, on Saturday afternoon. The bus, which had only a few people on board, was heading towards Dattatreya junction from Malleswaram around 3.10 p.m. when the incident took place.\\nThe driver later claimed it was brake failure. Unable to stop the bus, he ran over a line of vehicles parked on the footpath before ploughing into the hotel even as pedestrians ran helter-skelter. Four people standing outside the hotel were injured.\\nThe bus came to a halt after it hit a stand and tables in the hotel. The police estimate that at least 40 people had a narrow escape.\\n“Fortunately, there were very few patrons in the hotel. The few customers inside and the staff were able to escape,” said a police officer, adding that four two-wheelers and a car were damaged.\\nEyewitnesses handed over the driver, Prateesh, to the police. “The bus driver claims that it was brake failure, and we are investigating this. He did not have a driving licence,” said the Malleswaram traffic police.\\nBased on the complaint filed by the hotel owner, Rizwan Pasha, the police have booked Prateesh under various sections of the Motor Vehicles Act. “We are waiting for the medical report to ascertain if he was driving under the influence of alcohol,” the police added.',\n",
       " 'The State on Saturday reported 3,014 new cases taking the total number of cases to 8,23,412.

From then onwards, the TPR has been on a decline consistently.\\nTPR, which is a vital marker in assessing the spread of an outbreak, is the percentage of people who are found to be infected by the virus from those who are being tested. While cumulative positivity rate takes into account all the people tested so far, the daily rate is for those tested on a particular day.\\nPointing out that the low TPR may be due to weekend effect, Giridhar R. Babu, member of the State’s COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said, “We need to wait and check for further drop in seven-day averages. There needs to be a better testing strategy in districts other than Bengaluru so that their testing rates are similar to that of Bengaluru. This is to get a realistic sense of the decreasing TPR,” he said.\\nDecline in deaths too\\nThe State has also been witnessing a decline in fatalities since the beginning of October. From 1.4% on October 29, the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) decreased to 0.92% on Saturday with 28 new deaths. With this, the toll rose to 11,168.

She had befriended them on the pretext of warding off evil spirits. The suspect, Narayani, was arrested by the police from a hideout.\\nThe victim, Sivakumar, 42, works at the Chennai harbour and is a resident of Palavakkam. His wife died in April, 2018, after her sari allegedly caught fire while she was cooking. Ms. Nayarani met Mr. Sivakumar and his daughter, while she was visiting her daughter, who is their neighbour. She convinced Mr. Sivakumar that his wife died due to evil spirits, and only a special puja could ward them off.\\nShe collected 102 sovereigns of jewellery and ₹8.6 lakh in cash from him for the puja. She reportedly told him that they should perform poojas, for a year, at her house. Only after a year did Mr. Sivakumar realise that he was being cheated. When he demanded that the jewellery be returned, she went absconding.\\nOn his complaint, the police also arrested a pawn broker, Rathanlal, 52, who had bought the jewellery from Ms. Narayani, and had later sold it off.

The main suspect was identified as Yuvaraj, 42, from Tiruvallur district. He is yet to be arrested.\\nHe had visited Meenatchipuram, the native of K. Rajakumaran, 45, a mini-truck owner in Tenkasi district, and had convinced him that his family was affected by evil spirits. As per the suspect’s instructions, the victim sold off his mini-truck for ₹5 lakh, and reached Chennai, along with his father-in-law, carrying ₹2 lakh in cash and two roosters. The gang collected the money and the roosters from him near the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, on the pretext of preparing for the puja, leaving the victim in the lurch.\\nA senior police officer said the main suspect engaged his associates to scout for potential victims. Based on the information shared by them, he would personally visit the families, pretending to be god-sent. He would offer to ward off evil spirits, on payment of money and being given roosters for puja. “We suspect the gang has cheated several people,” the officer said.',\n",

Let’s move on...”\\n“No problem,” she got up, grabbed her luggage, and again we started trudging through the crowded aisle.\\nFinally, we found her destination while I was wondering how stupid have I been. This haphazard arrangement of coaches was bound to embarrass me in front of a foreigner, but I should have at least checked the numbers. She settled down and thanked me.

This is the fourth and the last of the foundational agreements that both countries have concluded, starting with GSOMIA (General Security of Military Information Agreement) in 2002, LEMOA (Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement) in 2016, COMCASA (Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement) in 2018, and now BECA.\\nWhat are foundational agreements?\\nThe United States enters into what are called ‘foundational or enabling agreements’ with its defence partners. These agreements govern the nature and scope of U.S. defence partnerships. Partners enhance the capabilities of the U.S. military in distant places through sharing information, platforms and logistics.\\nALSO READ\\nBECA treaty and the long view on India-U.S. talks | The Hindu In Focus podcast\\n The competitive advantage of the U.S. military is maintained primarily by the advanced technologies that the country develops continuously. The U.S. sells military equipment to other countries with strict control over their deployment and use. For instance, consider the B777-300ER aircraft that India bought from Boeing recently for the use of VVIPs. The sale of advanced communication and security systems on the aircraft — which are not commercially available — is made seamless by foundational agreements.\\nThe U.S. is also eager to advance ‘interoperability’ with defence forces of the countries that are its defence partners. Interoperability involves real-time coordination of forces. The U.S. has signed these foundational agreements with at least 100 countries, which mostly follow a standard text. Country-specific changes were made in India’s case in all four foundational agreements.\\nWhat do these agreements do?\\nThe General Security of Military Information Agreement or GSOMIA, and its extension, the Information Security Annex (ISA) signed in 2019, allow military technology cooperation for the sharing of classified information between governments and companies in both countries. The LEMOA enables logistics support, say refuelling of planes or ships, supply of spare parts or maintenance to each other. For instance, U.S. Navy’s P8 aircraft landed in Port Blair last month for refuelling, under LEMOA. Even in the absence of this agreement, such cooperation can and has taken place between India and the U.S., but the agreement makes it seamless, and the accounting easier. The COMCASA allows Indian forces to procure advanced, secure communication equipment from the U.S. Such equipment was earlier denied for U.S. origin platforms such as C-17, C-130, and commercial systems were used in their place. Only after COMCASA was signed were the encrypted systems provided to India.\\nAlso read | Industrial Security Annex opens Indian private partnerships for U.S. defence firms\\nThe BECA enables exchange of geospatial information. Akin to a GPS that enables navigation, such exchange of geospatial information enhances the accuracy of a missile or the utility of a drone.\\nWhat is the strategic importance of these agreements?\\nSince the Civil Nuclear Agreement of 2005, the India-U.S. defence cooperation has been advancing at a rapid pace. The U.S. has relaxed restrictions on technology trade in India’s favour considerably, and India is designated a ‘Major Defence Partner’. Foundational agreements deepen defence cooperation, in trade and operation. India and the U.S. are also part of a broader shared vision for the Indo-Pacific region, where both countries, along with Japan and Australia, are increasing their military cooperation. U.S.-built platforms used by partner countries can talk to one another and share operational information.\\nComment | The India-U.S. defence partnership is deepening\\nAre there any concerns?\\nCritics worry that tying itself too closely with the U.S. may limit India’s choices. The evolution of technology makes it inevitable that all military platforms will be integrated and networked in the future. The U.S. is very particular about the integrity of its networks, and pressure could mount on India to remain firmly in its camp. The U.S. is particularly irked by India’s continuing defence cooperation with Russia. India will be taking the delivery of Russian S-400 missile defence system next year, ignoring American objections. The U.S. could respond with sanctions. At any rate, it will not be possible to integrate Russian and American platforms, and this could throw up new challenges of military planning for India.\\nWatch | India and U.S. sign BECA\\n The moot question, say experts, is whether India could ramp up its defence cooperation with the U.S. without ending up as its ally.',\n",

Nagar constituency on Saturday and said, “It is certain that Munirathna will win this election by a large margin and become a Minister.”\\nSinging praises of Mr. Munirathna, he said that even before the bypolls were announced, Mr. Munirathna had been working for the development of the constituency.\\nMr. Yediyurappa went on to assure voters that he would give all support for development works in the constituency. “And as Minister, Munirathna will get them executed,” he said. This comes a day after he assured the voters of Sira, the other bypoll-bound constituency, that he would order the filling up of Madalur tank from Hemavathi river.\\nPromises galore\\n“In the last year alone, I have sanctioned development projects worth ₹820 crore for R.R. Nagar constituency,” he said, giving a breakup of the funds allotted for roads, underpasses, and drains. Also holding the charge of Bengaluru Development, he said he had taken a personal interest in the development of the city. “In the next one month, I will myself start doing city rounds to speed up the development works,” he said.\\nTaking a dig at the Congress and the JD(S), which he accused of playing “caste politics” — an alleged attempt to consolidate Vokkaliga votes against the BJP in R.R. Nagar — he said, “Our government has several Vokkaliga Ministers. We have ensured social justice and ours is a government of all castes. We do not depend on one caste like the Opposition parties.”\\nAnother trip to Delhi\\nMeanwhile, Mr. Yediyurappa also said he would make a trip to Delhi after the bypolls to consult the party’s central leadership on the matter of Cabinet expansion. “I want to expand the Cabinet soon after the elections,” he said. When asked whether it would be an expansion or a reshuffle, he said that would depend on the directions of the high command. He said he could not elaborate on the matter now, partly because of the model code of conduct being in force.\\nA Cabinet expansion/reshuffle has been a long-pending exercise in the State. Though the Chief Minister has been keen, the party high command has not given him the green signal for it yet. On his last trip to Delhi, on September 19, when he met the Prime Minister as well, he failed to secure clearance for the exercise from the central leadership, triggering speculation of a leadership change in State BJP.',\n",

I will wait until November 10 and will consider buying more, based on the demand. With salary cuts and job losses, crackers would be at the bottom of consumers’ shopping list.”\\nAnother retailer, who puts up three stalls on the Island Grounds in Chennai, says, “I have not invested much this year.

On an average, production has fallen by 20%-30%.\\n“Production is slightly down but orders have been good. People who were under lockdown for several months now want to go out, shop and celebrate. So this Deepavali will certainly be good,” asserts P.

The road was being laid in gross violation of the Forest (Conservation) Act and the Wildlife Protection Act. The new road and the resultant vehicular movement could endanger the KMTR’s core and threaten its very survival, and activists have called for a halt to this activity.\\nType-I unit\\nKMTR was declared a tiger reserve in 1988, the first in Tamil Nadu. It has been identified as a Type-I tiger conservation unit representing the tropical moist evergreen forests. It also forms part of the inter-State Agasthiyarmalai Biosphere Reserve, declared one of the plant diversity centres by UNESCO.\\nIt was also declared the Regional Centre of Endemism in the Indian subcontinent. There are 2,255 species of Angiosperms so far recorded from the KMTR, including 448 species endemic to the Western Ghats, in addition to 150 species that are strictly endemic to the Agasthiyarmalai, say researchers working in the reserve.\\nAccording to activists, this core habitat is one of the highly protected areas with the least entry points. One has to cross the Papanasam checkpoint and reach the Mundanthurai plateau and thereon travel to Servalar and the Karaiyar dam inside the core.\\nThe vehicular movement is usually restricted up to the dam, as pucca roads have been laid only up to that. Only 5 kani tribal settlements are present in the core area. There are very few elephant areas in the reserve.\\nAbout 10 years ago, trekking was also stopped. There are only patrolling/combing routes available from the Karaiyar dam to Kalivarpul until recently, which lead to Bomacadu (Kerala border). The forest staff and the anti-poaching watchers were patrolling the forest by foot, say activists.\\nImportantly, activists and researchers said these were the few tropical evergreen patches left in the country, free from any man-made interventions and serving as a water catchment for the perennial Tamirabharani river.\\nAlleging that heavy machinery was being operated now to clear rainforest patch along Karaiyar-Kannikatti-Kalivarpul Mottai for 30 km, the activists say such clearing would amount to loss of biodiversity, encourage a larger vehicular movement and allow easy access to poachers and even Maoist infiltration.\\nAnd for an area that had no road entry, creating a road by clearing the forest inside the core area raises suspicion, they add.\\n“Another reason for laying the road could be to facilitate access for high-profile pilgrims to the Agasthiyar temple in the peak in vehicles. Now they have to trek,” says an activist.\\nKMTR field director Yogesh Singh did not react and said the local officer (a deputy director) would answer. KMTR deputy director (Ambasamudram division) Kommu Omkaram denied that heavy equipment was used to lay roads in the core zone between the Papanasam dam and Kalibar Pullmottai. The 30-km ‘katcha’ road connecting the border with Kerala through the dense jungle would usually be maintained to ensure the movement of the vehicles of KMTR officials to reach the spots within the shortest possible time.\\n“Since this area would witness heavy winds throughout the year, uprooting of huge trees is quite usual, and would make our travel inside the core zone tougher. Even then we don’t lay ‘pucca roads’ in this area fearing that it would encourage the entry of outsiders. We used to remove only periodically the wild growth that would cover the ‘katcha’ roads,” he said.\\nA retired forest official, a native of the region, said forest officials should continue to trek the region and not lay new roads for them to travel in jeeps. The road plan should be immediately abandoned. Initially, forest officials would only say they would travel on the route. Then the political pressure would make them open up the road for more people.

       " 'People of Telangana have lived through eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic and there might be more to come. In the 244 days since March 2, when the first case was detected in the State, over 2.4 lakh people have been infected so far and the virus has claimed 1,341 lives. However, of late, people seem to have become relaxed about precautions without realising that the challenges are far from over.\\nEight months into the pandemic, Health department officials are estimating another surge in cases as a large number of people stepped out of home for Bathukamma and Dasara festivals. The festival gatherings was the centre of discussions during a review meeting held by Health Minister Eatala Rajender with COVID-19 Expert Committee on Saturday. In fact, foreseeing the possibility of a surge, officials had earlier urged people not to participate in large scale gatherings, and to restrict celebrations only to close family members.\\n Besides, since any virus finds cold temperatures favourable, officials opined that COVID’s virulence might increase in the winter.\\nHowever, these two are not the sole reasons for estimated surge. The recent floods in Hyderabad and large gatherings during election campaigning could also contribute to the possibility. During the spell of heavy rain last month, sewage water entered several homes, while silt and garbage covered streets. With that distress and grief over loss of life and property, COVID fear was relegated to second position; safety was the prime concern of the people.\\nSaturday was not the first time that the possibility of spike in COVID-19 cases in Telangana was discussed. In the past week, apprehensions of a surge were discussed in meetings by officials of the Health department, Panchayat Raj department, and Women and Child Welfare department.\\nThe second wave of the pandemic is sweeping through European nations and surge is also witnessed in the USA. In India, spike has been observed in Delhi and Kerala. These aspects, apart from bed strength, oxygen availability and details regarding other infrastructural capacity, was discussed at the meeting.\\n Testing and deaths\\nBetween March 2 and October 31, a total of 43,23,666 samples have been tested, leading to the detection of 2,40,048 positive cases. The government had come under sharp criticism for low testing until mid-June, after which the number of tests were increased from a maximum of 4,000 a day in June to around 60,000 daily towards August-end. By the end of October, around 40,000 people were being examined.\\nOf the total cases, 18,241 are active while 2,20,466 have recovered and 1,341 patients have died. One of the important observations is regarding the drop in the number of daily COVID deaths. While eight to 10 deaths were reported till September-end, it gradually dropped to four to six deaths per day. Telangana High Court on October 12 said the death statistics furnished by the Public Health department were not trustworthy.\\nSenior officials of Health department insist the deaths are not under-reported. Director of Medical Education K. Ramesh Reddy said that with better understanding of the infectious disease and drugs such as steroids and heparin, they have been able to bring down the death rate. He remarked earlier people underwent testing only when symptomatic. “Precious time was lost and the disease progressed. Now, we are reaching out to people and identifying cases in early stages. Treatment starts even when a person is asymptomatic which avoids disease progression,” he said.',\n",

       " 'The outbreak of COVID-19 has shown that the health infrastructure of West Bengal had collapsed, State’s Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar said on Sunday. “COVID-19 has showed us all one thing, our health infrastructure in the State of West Bengal collapsed…And the reason for that is ill-advised, unfortunate confrontational stance of the State government to the well-meaning schemes of Central government,” he said, referring to the non-implementation of Ayushman Bharat scheme in the State.\\nHe said if the scheme was implemented it would have meant enhancement of medical and treatment facilities in the State. “Unfortunately, people of State are paying a heavy price,” he said.\\nThe State is witnessing about 4,000 new infections and between 55 to 60 deaths on a daily basis due to COVID-19. The case positivity rate of the State has increased to 8.20 %.\\nDarjeeling visit\\nThe Governor made these remarks while interacting with journalists in Siliguri in Darjeeling district. Mr. Dhankhar is on a visit to Darjeeling district and is likely to spend few weeks in the picturesque hills. In a 90-minute interaction with journalists, the Governor said that about 70 lakh farmers were denied benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi in West Bengal.\\nThe issue of non-implementation of Central schemes has been a subject of debate in the State. The Trinamool Congress government maintains that it has its own health scheme where treatment in State-run hospitals is free. The West Bengal also has a Krishak Bandhu scheme where financial assistance is extended to farmers of the State. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has recently written to Ministry of Health and Agriculture saying that the State was willing to implement the schemes provided it is routed through the State government.\\nAlso read: West Bengal reports highest single-day recoveries\\n‘BJP spokesperson’\\nThe Trinamool Congress leadership said that the Governor was working as a “spokesperson of the BJP”. “The only job which the Governor is doing is to target the State government almost on a regular basis. We have urged him time and again to refrain from such comments,” Saugata Roy, Trinamool Congress MP, said. Mr. Roy said that he did not want to give any importance of Mr. Dhankhar’s comments. “He is acting against Constitution and demeaning his office,” the Trinamool MP said.\\nThe Governor visit to Darjeeling comes at a time when the hills are seeing fresh political activity with the return of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha founder Bimal Gurung. Mr. Gurung who was in political exile for three years made a public appearance in Kolkata last month breaking his ties with the BJP and announcing support to Ms. Banerjee.\\nSpeaking to journalists in Siliguri, the Governor once again said that senior administrative officials in the State should rise above politics and work freely and fairly.

       " \"The Congress government in Rajasthan on Saturday introduced three Bills in the State Assembly to stop the applicability of the three, new agriculture sector legislations enacted by the Centre recently. The Amendment Bills have several provisions to address the farmers' concerns about livelihood security and the minimum support prices (MSP) regime.\\nThe Bills were tabled following a similar move in the Punjab Assembly, where a resolution against the farm laws was adopted and four Bills were passed last week to counter the Central legislations. The Rajasthan Cabinet had recently decided to convene a special session of the Assembly to protect the interests of farmers.\\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Shanti Dhariwal tabled the three Bills on the first day of the session along with another Bill seeking to amend the Civil Procedure Code for protecting the agriculturists' land measuring up to 5 acres against attachment and sale in execution of a decree issued by the court in the cases of monetary award.\\nThe three Bills pertaining to the State amendments to the Central statutes are the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020, the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) (Rajasthan Amendment) Bill, 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Special Provisions and Rajasthan Amendment) Bill 2020.\\nThe first Bill sought to restore agricultural safeguards in the State through the regulatory framework of the Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Markets Act, 1961, to secure the livelihood of farmers, farm labourers and others engaged in agriculture and related activities. It has provided for imprisonment of three to seven years along with fine for harassment of farmers.\\nThe proposed legislation also stated that no farming agreement for the sale or purchase of a crop would be valid unless the price paid for the agricultural produce was equal to, or greater than, the prevailing MSP announced by the Central government.\\nThe second Bill sought to make an amendment for levying of fee or cess on notified agricultural produce bought by a corporate or trader and for resolution of disputes between the farmer and a trade through the Agricultural Produce Markets Act. The powers of civil courts in dispute resolution will be restored through this provision.\\nThe third Bill proposed to protect the consumers from hoarding and black-marketing of agricultural produce and secure the interests of farmers. Unlike the Central Act which had removed the ceiling on the stock of farm commodities, the Bill sought to give powers to the State government to regulate the production, supply and distribution and impose stock limits under extraordinary circumstances.\\nAccording to the statement of objects and reasons for the Bills, the Parliament had introduced a mechanism which was “vulnerable to encroachment and manipulation” by vested corporate interests, leaving the farmers open to the vagaries of market forces. There was no guarantee for MSP and no check against exploitation of farmers, it said.\\n“There has been [an] extraordinary outrage among the farmers, farm labourers and others... The direct consequence of the Central Acts will be to nullify the MSP mechanism that has stood the test of time and introduce several other infirmities and distortions operating to the grave detriment and prejudice of agriculture and the communities associated with it,” said the statement.\\nWhile affirming that agriculture, land and markets were the primary legislative domain of the State falling under Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, the State government said the Central Acts were beyond the legislative competence of the Parliament. “The State government can amend the Central Acts in exercise of its powers vested under Article 254(2) of the Constitution,” it said.\\nThe Assembly was adjourned till Monday after obituary references on the death of former President Pranab Mukherjee and some other leaders following the introduction of Bills. Senior BJP MLA Rajendra Rathore, who is Deputy Leader of Opposition, said the Central laws were in favour of farmers and added that his party would prove its stand during the debate in the House.\\nChief Minister Ashok Gehlot had recently questioned the intent of the BJP government at the Centre behind bringing the “black legislations” during the COVID-19 pandemic. He said the Bills had been tabled without any discussion with the State governments and other stakeholders and passed in a “questionable manner”.\\nLarge sections of farmers in the State have been opposing the farm laws and the agriculturists' groups staged demonstrations and participated in rallies during the Bharat bandh called on the issue last month. Small and marginal farmers have expressed apprehensions about the impact of these legislations on their livelihood, MSP, public distribution system and Krishi Upaj Mandis.\",\n",

We are anguished that your Central forces have used coercive means to deal with members of public today in railway stations, which is deplorable.”\\nThe Home Secretary also said the State government has helped run metro stations peacefully and efficiently. The Metro Railway in Kolkata resumed services in September and is carrying more than 70,000 passengers on a weekday.\\nThe development also comes at a time when the Ministry of Railways has announced resumption of more suburban special trains in Mumbai.\\nThe demand for resuming suburban train services has been gaining ground with several leaders of the BJP also supporting it.

This positive impact of the strategy could also be seen from the increase in number of streets that was free of the infection.\\nAs of October 31, the number of streets free from the infection was 6,608. It was 5,876 on September 30. The total number of streets in the city was 7,569.\\nLikewise, the number of streets with three-plus COVID-19 positive cases stood at 1,300 on September 30.

This, if seen with the population that the Corporation had covered through its fever camps to identify persons with influenza-like infection would show the true picture of the civic body’s efforts, the sources pointed out and added that as of October 31, the civic body had covered 13.06 lakh persons in the city of over 20 lakh.\\nThe Corporation had conducted over 11,000 such camps and continued to hold 90 to 100 camps a day.\\nEven the number of persons in home quarantine had come down.

It was for this reason that the Corporation had extended till November 30 the door-to-door survey to identify people with fever or other health ailments, the sources added.',\n",
       " 'The name ‘Tondaradipodi’ is eponymous of the inherent nature of this Azhwar which is to serve the bhagavatas and bhaktas of God. Though his original name is Vipranarayana, this name has come to stay. ‘Tondar’ is a devotee and servant of God, ‘adi’ is the feet of the devotee and ‘podi’ is the dust from the devotee’s feet. The swabhava which makes one respectful to not only God but to show the same respect to all His devotees is central to bhagavata dharma, pointed out Sri A.K. Sundarrajan in a discourse. This bhava that sees no difference between serving God or His devotees takes root in one who has internalised the truth that the Lord is equally present in all aspects of the entire creation that includes the ‘chit’ and the ‘achit.’\\nTondaradipodi Azhwar’s life and his two famous hymns, the Tirumaalai and the Tirupalliyezhuchi, show his eagerness to make all jivatmas devotees of God. In the Tirumaalai, he alternates between the mode of self talk and direct conversation with Lord Ranganatha. For instance, he explains in a hymn how all beings endowed with the jnanendriyas, karmendriyas and a mind are not able to see this as God’s gift to them to be used to realise Him. Instead, they get involved in worldly matters and are caught deep in samsara. They only seek to be born in this world while the chance to realise God is available if only they can at least chant the name ‘Ranga’ or Srirangam. This Divya Kshetra is the residence of the Supreme Lord of Vaikunta, the Jagat Rakshaka, and the sole cause of all existence. Proficiency in the sastras may have its own value, but does not guarantee realisation. But the state of God realisation, jnana, is possible only by the grace of the Lord, says Azhwar as he himself has experienced it in his own life.',\n",

In the month of September, GST collection was 4% higher than what was there in the corresponding period last year,” Mr. Pandey said.\\n“In the month of October, it has risen by 10% year-on-year with a collection of above ₹1.05 lakh crore,” he added.\\nMr. Pandey said the generation of e-way bills, which is mandatory for transporting goods worth over ₹ 50,000, has gone up 21% in October, while the number of e-invoice generation has touched 29 lakh IRNs (Invoice Reference Numbers) a day.\\nAlso read: India to pursue self reliance, encourage domestic entrepreneurs, says Rajiv Kumar\\n“E-way bill and e-invoice coupled with better GST collections show that the economy was not only on path of recovery but also returning to the growth path and picking up steadily,” Mr. Pandey, who is also the Revenue Secretary, said.\\nThe gross direct tax collection in April-October period of the current fiscal stood at ₹4.95 lakh crore, down 22% over the same period last fiscal.\\nWhile corporate tax collection fell 26% to ₹2.65 lakh crore, personal income tax collection was 16% lower at ₹2.34 lakh crore.\\nTax and GST refunds\\nGST collection in April-October period of the current fiscal stood at ₹5.59 lakh crore, 20% lower than the collection in the same period last fiscal.\\nNotwithstanding the dip in revenues, the government has issued ₹1.27 lakh crore worth of income tax refunds and ₹70,000 crore GST refunds so far this fiscal.\\n“In last 7 months, a total ₹2 lakh crore refund was issued. This was during the time when our collection was less,” Mr. Pandey said.\\nHe said the focus on faceless assessment, third-party information gathering and sharing of data between various agencies has helped improve tax collection by making it difficult for people to evade taxes.\\nAlso read: India’s economy to contract by 10.3%, says International Monetary Fund\\n“So the tendency to take advantage of the information asymmetry and take risk of tax evasion would be much much lower,” he said.\\nMr. Pandey said the department is collecting third-party information like taxpayer’s consumption pattern, bank statement, mutual fund and share transaction, property transaction, import, export and foreign remittances.\\n“The economic impact of pandemic would have been much more if our tax collection system had not improved.

These would incentivise people to furnish correct tax information,” he added.\\n“The system analyses the information asymmetry and issues red flags. So the risk premium is very high on tax evasion.

       " \"Revenues from the Goods and Services Tax surpassed ₹1.05 lakh crore in October, up 10% from a year ago, and the highest recorded since February 2020. \\nThe government cited the GST inflows that crossed the ₹1 lakh crore mark for the first time in this financial year as a ‘clear’ sign of a recovery in the economy after its 23.9% contraction in the first quarter of this year. However, economists and businesses are cautious about the sustainability of this trend.\\nStates’ dues could fall \\nTax experts said the expected shortfall in GST compensation for the States could be lower than the current estimate of ₹2.35 lakh crore if this revenue momentum is maintained through the rest of 2020-21. \\nAs per data released by the Finance Ministry on Sunday, the gross GST revenue collected in October was ₹1,05,155 crore, 10.25% higher than a year ago, and 10.1% more than the indirect tax revenue garnered in September. “The growth in GST revenue as compared to that in the months of July, August and September 2020, of -14%, -8% and 5% respectively, clearly shows the trajectory of recovery of the economy and, correspondingly, of the revenues,” the Ministry said. \\nTerming the surge in the GST kitty in October 2020 as ‘enthusing’, principal economist at rating agency ICRA Aditi Nayar said this was in line with the expectation of a build-up of inventories in anticipation of a robust festive season. However, she added, “We remain as yet unconvinced on the persistence of this trend after the festive season is over, after the pent-up demand is fulfilled.”\\nThe Hindu Explains | Where are the funds collected through cess parked?\\nThe uptick in October's GST inflows could be attributed to the festive demand and input tax credits as well as other reconciliations that were due for businesses in September, said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY. \\n“If this level of revenues is maintained through the rest of 2020-21, we may see a reduction in the shortfall in GST compensation for the States,” Mr. Jain said. \\nGST cess collections, used to compensate the States for switching to the GST regime, rose to ₹8,011 crore (including ₹932 crore collected on import of goods). This is over 5% more than a year ago and 12.5% higher than the previous month. The total revenue earned in October by the Central and State governments stood at ₹44,285 crore and ₹44,839 crore, respectively.\\nAlso read | Centre used GST compensation cess elsewhere, violated law: CAG\\nAmong the States, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh recorded the highest 26% growth in GST collections in October year-on-year, followed by Jharkhand (23%) and Rajasthan (22%). Odisha clocked 21% growth as did the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir. The trend in the more industrially developed States was mixed, with 15% growth in Gujarat, 13% in Tamil Nadu and just 5% in Maharashtra. \\nOctober’s GST inflows must not be considered a return to normalcy for businesses, said the Consortium of Indian Associations, an umbrella body of micro, small and medium enterprises, stressing that these revenues normally relate to sales that occurred in September, when a majority of the economy, including public transport, were unlocked. \\n“Many companies raised sale invoices in September by pushing out their finished products which they had planned in March itself. We need to await data for November and December before we can confidently say the economy has rebounded to pre-COVID-19 days,” said K.E. Raghunathan, the consortium’s convenor. \\nOctober’s revenues from import of goods were 9% higher, while domestic transactions (including import of services) yielded 11% higher revenues, on a year-on-year basis. \",\n",

       " 'You may have watched the ‘Mutual Fund Sahi Hai’ investor initiatives that attempt to spread awareness about mutual funds. One such initiative suggests you should buy overnight funds as ‘net practice’ before investing in other (read equity) funds.\\nHere, we discuss why you cannot get ‘net practice’ for investing to achieve your goals.\\nRoutine versus non-routine\\nLike most individuals, you may be good at grocery shopping, typically grabbing a discount when you see one. But there is a reason why your skill at grocery shopping cannot be replicated in your investment decisions.\\nWe are typically good at taking decisions for routine issues because good decision-making comes out of experience. And, experience comes from learning (including taking bad decisions). So, if you buy groceries every fortnight and make bad decisions (buying a day or two before the store offers discounts), you can eventually understand the store’s discount policy and accordingly adjust your future purchases.\\nUnfortunately, it is not often that you buy a house.\\nAnd, you retire only once. You may rightly point out that all of us pursue several goals during our lifetime. Suppose you are investing to achieve two goals — buying a house five years hence and funding your child’s education with a 10-year horizon. Also, suppose you make mistakes in managing down payment-for the house. Can you learn from these mistakes and manage your child’s education portfolio better? Not necessarily. Why?\\nNot all goals you pursue at any point in time will have the same priority. For instance, funding your child’s education portfolio may be more important than buying a house. So, the risk you are willing to take and, therefore, your choice of investment products to achieve high-priority goals, will be different compared to your choice of products for low-priority goals.\\nOf course, this does not mean that you cannot learn from your investment experience. But, you have to appreciate that no two investment experiences will be the same.\\nThere is another way to convince yourself to invest in equity funds. Suppose you decide to invest only in bank fixed deposits to achieve a life goal. Imagine the amount of money you have to save every month, given that your post-tax return on bank deposits is less than 4%.\\nHigher savings, an option?\\nWould you like to cut your current consumption and save more? Or, do you want to stick with current consumption and invest in high-expected-return-investments such as equity funds? From a behavioural perspective, cutting your current consumption is more painful than the likelihood of suffering losses on your equity investments in the future.\\nAlso, there is a possibility of regret if you do not save enough to achieve your life goal.\\nSo, think of investing in equity funds as a requirement to achieving your goal. To test the waters, you could, perhaps, invest in index funds before you are ready to invest in active funds. Finally, remember this: you (typically) only invest once for each life goal.\\n(The author offers training programmes for individuals to manage their personal investments)',\n",

Is it possible to start a health insurance policy right now and get a claim now itself for an eye operation?\\nT. K. Vineeth Parameswaran\\nA. Hospitalisation policies do not cover pre-existing conditions for an initial stated period and no claim will be entertained for the first 30 days of coverage except in the case of hospitalisation following an accident. Some procedures like cataract surgery are covered after two years of unbroken insurance.\\nHaving seen that, how to fund your mother’s eye operation is the question. Two options that may be available are as follows. Being a State government employee, your mother is likely to be covered already under an employer’s scheme. Please check eligibility under the scheme. State government employees are also usually eligible for treatment in government hospitals free or at very nominal costs.\\nSurrender, or take a loan?\\nQ. I am a retired professor (84) living with my wife (83). We have no children. We have 14 LIC policies, eight in my name with my wife being the nominee. The others are in my wife‘s name with me being the nominee.\\nWe are not willing to name anybody else as our nominee. We want to realise the policy money ourselves within our lifetime. There are four different policies — Whole Life, Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana, Jeevan Akshay IV and Jeevan Shanti.\\nI am also aware of the surrender facility. Can we surrender these policies before maturity?\\nDr. M. R. Santhanam\\nA. Policy surrender rules differ from policy to policy and LIC, and other companies, change them periodically.\\nTo give a broad idea, a whole life policy can be surrendered after three years of being in force and you will get 30% of the premiums paid, excluding the first-year premium. If it is a single premium policy, then 90% of the premium is the guaranteed surrender value.\\nThat is a minimum. You will have to read up your policy bond or approach the LIC to work out the actual surrender value.\\nJeevan Akshay IV is an immediate annuity plan and has no surrender value.\\nIf you have taken a deferred annuity plan under Jeevan Shanti, surrender is possible whether it was single life or joint life with your spouse. The quantum will be worked out by the insurer for you on request. If it was immediate annuity, surrender would be possible only if the option you chose was annuity for life with return of purchase price, both in the case of individual or joint life.\\nVarishtha Pension Bima Yojana is a social security scheme of the government administered by LIC. Under this, there is no option for surrender.\\nExcept for the last policy, if surrender is not possible, you should explore loan options with the LIC to unlock your policies financially during your lifetime as per your preference. Please take care to explore these only with your insurer and not those unrelated.\\n(The writer is a business journalist specialising in insurance & corporate history)',\n",

This allowed them to build relationships with their constituents.\\nIn a private realm of communication, content moderation is virtually non-existent, allowing dissemination of false and misleading information, the team said.\\nThe team highlighted an example which constituted a text message on former Vice President Joe Biden endorsing gender change treatments for eight- and ten-year old’s, and that is too extreme to be supported. This message, claiming to come from an unnamed ‘Democratic volunteer’, began lighting up on people’s phones in swing U.S. states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania the week before the 2020 election.\\nThe text message contained a short video paid for by conservative think-tank American Principles Project (APP). Phone calls to the phone numbers sending the messages failed as they had been disconnected. APP paid Rumble Up, a conservative company offering texting services, over $58,000, as of October 2020, the team stated.\\nBiden's remarks on children's transgender rights have been misrepresented and misused online.

P2P texting can also give rise to phishing scams, which were previously originating only from emails.\\nThe team notes that this isn't the first time misinformation is being spread via text messages. In the 2016 Presidential Election, fraudulent voter registration-related SMS messages, seemingly deployed by Republican campaigns, were sent to voters in several states.

This is an indicator of buoyancy in the economy. The revenue generated through freight was ₹38.44 crore in September 2020 as against ₹35 crore in September 2019. However, the half yearly cumulative load for the period April to September is low because of the lockdown. As against 1,289 rakes that were loaded in 2019 during April-September, 751 rakes were loaded during the current financial year.\\nThe main freight transported by the division is iron ore. Tthe Railways managed to secure confirmed orders from Mysore Minerals Enterprises, Chitradurga, and the ores are transported to Tornagallu.\\nDuring the lockdown period, the Railways launched the Business Development Unit in July with the objective of giving a thrust to freight traffic and enabling ease of doing business. The objective was to increase and double the freight traffic post-lockdown and this is paying dividends, sources said. The major freight customers for the division include players in the iron and steel, mining, cement and agriculture sectors.\\nThe traction in the movement of cement, iron ore, fertilizers, etc., are indicators of growth in the economy and efforts will be doubled to give a boost to freight traffic, the sources added.\\nBut the shadow of the pandemic continues to loom large on the passenger earning segment as the number of people travelling has dipped and it is a long haul ahead to return to the pre-pandemic level of traffic.

As they began the work, they constantly showed their works to each other through screen sharing applications.\\nThe primary aim of the video seems to be to raise an awareness of the kind of struggle that the renaissance leaders had to go through to put an end to many social evils.\\nPowerful drawings\\nFeatured are some powerful drawings on Ayyankali's Villuvandi samaram against the prohibitions imposed on lower castes from venturing into the public roads and Narayana Guru's consecration of a Shiva idol at Aruvippuram. Lesser known reformers like Arattupuzha Velayudha Panicker who organised the ‘Mookkuthi viplavam’ and other struggles are also featured.\\nThe video ends with the exhortation that people should realise where we started from and that we have to constantly tell ourselves that equality was not achieved naturally, but through a lot of struggle.\",\n",

       " 'Having run through 74% of its labour budget under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) at the halfway point of the year, and expecting the demand to go up still further in a pandemic year, Bihar has asked the Centre for an additional six crore persondays of work to be added to its budget, State Rural Development (RD) Secretary Arvind Kumar Chaudhary told The Hindu.\\nHowever, despite the unprecedented increase in employment provided under the scheme this year, the demand is higher still, and at least one in five people who demanded work has not received it. According to workers and activists on the ground, local corruption and fraud means that many more people are being denied MGNREGA work than is reflected in the data, forcing migrants to return to the cities for work.\\nBihar’s approved labour budget for 2020-21 is 18 crore persondays of work, but 13.3 crore persondays have already been used up, in providing work to almost 44 lakh people, according to official data. By the time the full figures for October are entered into the official system in a few weeks, the State may well have crossed the 14 crore persondays of work that were provided in the whole of the previous year.\\nDemand-driven scheme\\n“MGNREGA is a demand-driven scheme, and we expected demand to be higher due to the pandemic and the migrants who returned during the lockdown,” said Mr. Chaudhary. “We have already requested the Centre for an increase in the labour budget to 24 crore persondays... Peak demand season for MGNREGA in Bihar is after ‘Chhat Puja’ [festival celebrated on November 20] until the end of the year, so I expect to cross 20 to 23 crore this year.” In fact, this increase is despite the fact that MGNREGA worksites were shut for much of April, due to the lockdown, and work provision had also been disrupted by floods and elections, he said. More than 13 lakh new job cards were issued, mostly to returning migrants.\\nNevertheless, a worrying 20% of the 54 lakh who demanded work were not provided work, even according to the official numbers.\\nMr. Chaudhary dismissed the concern. Work offered was higher than work provided, he said. “If someone applies for MGNREGA work, but then gets a better offer within the next 15 days, they may not show up at the worksite”.\\nWorkers’ version\\nWorkers find the notion of refusing work laughable.\\n“In my village, we would work for 365 days if the work was provided. I would settle for 150 days of work a year, but this year, I have only been able to get 20 days of work so far,” says Manvi Devi, an MGNREGA worker from Rampur Kodarkatti village in Bihar’s Araria district. The sole earner in her family, she detailed the laborious, long-winded process of demanding work. Panchayat officers were unavailable, and even when chased down, were unwilling to register the demand for work, and issued a receipt to workers as envisaged under the law.\\n“Villagers who had come back from outside tried to register for job cards, but they were asked to pay ₹500 bribe and show a lot of documents. Many of them have gone back to Delhi, Surat, Haryana now because there is no work here,” she said.\\nIn Jitendra’s village of Chitauria, in Katihar district, one major project to build a road near the river employed 250-300 MGNREGA workers for about a month in late May and June. “I got 30 days of work, but after that there has been nothing. Because of floods, agricultural work has been limited also, so we would be eager for MGNREGA work if we could get it, even though wages are low and payment is usually delayed”, he said.\\nHe stated that corrupt sarpanches and mukhiyas who registered muster rolls with fake names, used machinery to complete work and then pocketed the funds meant for wages meant that the number of people who wanted work and didn’t get it was even higher than on paper. “The law says the government must register demand, give a job within15 days, pay unemployment allowance if work is not provided, pay wages within 15 days. But in Bihar, none of that happens. The government is crippling the law,” he added.\\n‘It’s farcical’\\nAshish Ranjan, secretary of the Jan Jagran Shakti Sangathan, a trade union for unorganised sector workers, said, “The actual demand process is farcical. In reality, it is supply-driven. If the government is able to open worksites, wherever the government is able to supply work, they show it as the demand”. He agreed that the pandemic, and increased funding for MGNREGA had led to an increase in work but insisted that the real demand was at least 50% higher.\\nMr. Chaudhary agreed that not enough had been done to provide work in the past but promised that the future would be different. “Generating demand is only one side of the equation. The supply side has been lacking. We have been augmenting supply side capabilities over the last few years. Next year, even without pandemic-driven demand, we are hoping to stay above 20 crore persondays,” he added.',\n",

I want to understand how their desires aligned,” Mr. Yadav told reporters.\\nTest for opposition\\nThe byelection will not only measure any anti-incumbency against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath but also test the strength of the opposition parties as they fight to claim the position of the main challenger in 2022. While the SP under Akhilesh Yadav, with a larger presence in the Assembly, has emerged as the frontrunner, the Congress has also staked a claim through the frequent visits to the State by its general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. Ms. Mayawati, however, has been relegated from ground politics especially since the 2019 Lok Sabha election which she contested along with the SP.\\nA poor performance in the bypoll would further dent her prospects.

In April, 2019, on account of physical proximity, the girl was found to be pregnant with the child of the man.

However, economists and businesses are cautious about the sustainability of this trend.\\nTax experts said the expected shortfall in GST compensation for States could be lower than the current estimate of ₹2.35 lakh crore, if this revenue momentum is maintained through the rest of 2020-21.\\nAs per data released by the Finance Ministry on Sunday, the gross GST revenue collected in October was ₹1,05,155 crore, 10.25% higher than a year ago, and 10.1% more than the indirect tax revenue garnered in September.\\n“The growth in GST revenue as compared to that in months of July, August and September, 2020, of -14%, -8% and 5%, respectively, clearly shows the trajectory of recovery of the economy and, correspondingly, of the revenues,” the Ministry said.\\nTerming the surge in the GST kitty in October 2020 as ‘enthusing’, principal economist at rating agency ICRA Aditi Nayar said this was in line with the expectation of a build-up of inventories in anticipation of a robust festive season. However, she added, “We remain as yet unconvinced on the persistence of this trend after the festive season is over, after the pent-up demand is fulfilled.”\\nThe uptick in October's GST inflows could be attributed to the festive demand and input tax credits as well as other reconciliations that were due for businesses in September, said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at EY.\\n“If this level of revenues is maintained through the rest of 2020-21, we may see a reduction in the shortfall in GST compensation for States,” Mr. Jain said.\\nGST Cess collections, used to compensate States for switching to the GST regime, rose to ₹8,011 crore (including ₹932 crore collected on import of goods).

We need to await data for November and December before we can confidently say the economy has rebounded to pre-COVID-19 days,” said K.E.

It is unclear whether the drop in daily cases and deaths registered in the urban areas is playing itself out similarly in rural areas as well, as unlike urban areas, the protocols for testing, treatment, isolation are not as diligently followed because of gaps in the rural health infrastructure across States.

When taken together with India’s refusal to engage with the Indian American lawmakers on the Democratic side, it became a public signalling of preference for the Republicans over the Democrats.\\nAlso read | I know the pride you feel about Kamala Harris’ nomination, Joe Biden tells Indian Americans in op-ed article\\nSurveys suggest a shift of Indian Americans from the Democratic camp to the Republican side, though an overwhelming majority continues to be with the first. Around 22% of Indian Americans support Mr. Trump, according to the Indian American Attitudes Survey (IAAS), while 68% (or 72% of the registered voters in the study) support Democrat Joe Biden.

Only less than half, 49%, are “more enthusiastic” about the Democratic ticket because of her candidacy, while 15% are “less enthusiastic” because of her candidacy; and only 45% Indian Americans are “more likely” to vote because one among them is a candidate.

Only 51% of Indian Americans are Hindus; and the support for Mr. Trump is highest among the 18% Christians. A survey among 520 randomly selected Indian Americans by Prof. Amitabh Mattoo suggests everything else being equal, up to 40% would vote for a candidate endorsed by Mr. Modi, while 20% disagreed with the idea.\\nIndian American politics has elements of nostalgia and grievance (the self-perception of being exiled by appeasement politics) with regard to India, and victimhood (racist experiences) and exceptionalism (claims of ‘the model minority’) in the U.S. Diaspora politics of Hindutva groups has reinforced these sentiments since 2014. Simplistic and ignorant American views of India as Hindu, vegetarian and a place ruined by socialism of the past are lapped up and relayed back by Hindutva diaspora activists.\\nGround Zero | The importance of being Indian in America\\nIndian American politicians, both Democrats and Republicans, are difficult to fit in the Hindutva straitjacket. On the Republican side, Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal are Christians and the former also ‘white.’ Democrats Ro Khanna and Pramila Jayapal are practising Hindus but critical of Hindutva.\\nThe same groups that were celebrating the fact that Ms. Jayapal took oath of office on the Bhagavad Gita in 2017 now oppose her for expressing concerns regarding Indian policies; Ms. Harris was attacked for a poster that depicted her as a Hindu goddess, though Indian leaders routinely appear as gods and goddesses.\\nAlso read | Indian Americans still strongly identify with Democratic Party, says survey\\nHyphenated identities\\nThe IAAS shows younger Indian Americans have more liberal views than their parents. Keeping the new generation on a tight leash is a key focus of Indian American activism, across all religious groups. At the World Hindu Congress (WHC) in Chicago in 2018, an exhibition that was pulled out after outrage, was titled ‘Interfaith marriages: Silent Holocaust of Hindus’. It warned youngsters of the dangers of such marriages — a topic that triggers intense reaction among cultural warriors at home and abroad.\\nAlso read | Hindus key voting bloc in swing States, says Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi\\nMs. Harris was born to parents who married interfaith, and she herself has married interfaith. India’s official policy has also leaned towards narrowing ‘Indian American’ to ‘Hindu American’, going against the grain of the Democratic Party which prefers wider categories to negotiate a landscape of increasing diversity. The Democrats underscore Ms. Harris’ identities as African American and South Asian, a category that Hindutva groups abhor. ‘Indian American’, as a typical hyphenated American identity, assumes a certain homogeneity across diverse linguistic and religious groups from India, and adds respectability to dual national loyalties, which is an accusation against minorities in India. However, double hyphenated identities throw not only diaspora politics but even India’s visa policy into a tailspin. Ms. Harris is African-Indian-American, or African-South Asian-American. American citizens of India-Pakistan mixed parentage find it impossible to travel to India, due to visa restrictions put in place during the United Progressive Alliance government, after the David Headley episode. The efforts to tap diaspora resources for advancing India-U.S. ties, also sought to streamline the community as an extension of the domestic cultural nationalism, by emphasising its Hindu identity. The Indian Embassy in Washington DC stopped celebrating Muslim festivals. The Chicago WHC had the Vice-President of India in attendance and the wholesome participation of Indian missions in the U.S.\\nAnalysis | More ups than downs, and many surprise turns in Trump’s foreign policy for India\\nIt is damaging at two levels at least. First, it accentuated the pre-existing divisions within the Indian American community on religious, caste and generational lines, in part mirroring trends within India, besides pushing it to delink from the larger south Asian identity. Second, the attempts by groups to corner Indian American lawmakers on Hindutva questions and the India-Pakistan conflict have created a self-defeating dynamics. If their careers are harmed, it is a net loss for the community. If they come to power, there is damage control to be done. At any rate, American-born Indian Americans appear to be taking a hard look at developments in India in light of the nativist politics around them.\\nA soft touch might work\\nIndian Americans may well be culturally rooted, but that does not automatically make them puppets of Hindutva cultural politics in the U.S. Those who might gladly support cultural nationalism in India need cultural diversity in the U.S. for self-preservation, and ally with the Democrats. Biden supporters are largely Modi supporters too. They might occasionally find common cause with the Republicans on the question of Islam, but will remain suspects in the highly Judeo-Christian world. In an inverse situation, Christians who are unlikely supporters of the majority cultural politics in India, appear to be enthusiastic about it in the U.S. Engagement with the diaspora can be beneficial for India, but aggressive efforts to navigate it can be counterproductive. Indian Americans will increasingly be like Kamala Harris — impossible to fit in any straightjacket.\\nWatch | Who is Kamala Harris?\\n varghese.g@thehindu.co.in',\n",

Aravind,\\nBengaluru\\nCultural mitosis in Indian society\\nI write this as Professor, Department of Political Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi. Cultural mitosis is producing new cultures, and the emerging changes in ‘belief’ and ‘relation’ in India are having an impact on freedom and the social structure.\\nThe structural and functional face of Indian society are dynamic. Dynamism of any society is always appreciated in conceptual and practical philosophy. But when this dynamism takes to a new creation with least possible inheritance from the past, an evaluation becomes desirable to understand the direction and destination of the new creation. In present day India, many groups of new ‘belief holders’ are surfacing, independent of their parent cultures, claiming to have authentic adherence to the group and wanting recognition as cultural communities. So what is the change in the cultural face of Indian society with its diversities? Can these new belief holders be considered a cultural community? Can these new groups attain the aims underlying their formation? And if we allow these to take place, what will be the face of new society?\\nIn second half of the second decade of present century, few yet unseen trends are becoming visible in Indian society. Though these are the growths from the upper middle classes and upper classes, these are now being articulated by the lower middle, and upper lower classes. There are innumerable fronts on which these changes and growths can be spotted but for the reasons of feasibility I will try in the present context to focus on two aspects: beliefs and relations. Two possible impacts of these new growths are on freedom and social structure.\\nMorality and rationality are no more accepted as essential foundations of a social organisation anywhere and in India. This is logical as in present world, no universal notion of rationality and morality can be expected to be acceptable. We have a sizeable number of theoreticians and philosophers who try to take a position where rationality and morality can be individually defined. They argue that any universal conception of these is no less than interference in the freedom of individual to own the self. But opposed to this view, we also have a sizeable number of scholars who maintain a position where rationality and morality become integrated in any organised society. They argue that no enactment is possible without any ‘all acceptable’ agreement and no fabric of social living can be thought of without enactment.\\nA society is recognised by its belief system. In the present context, beliefs include value, tradition, faith and living preferences. Traditional Indian society in its segment and period had at its root certain common features. A particular religious orientation, a way of salvation, a dress sense, a sexual orientation and a particular type of social and societal ranking were some of the issues on which there was agreement within a particular community. Faith-based morality, later converted into reason-based morality, and was the testing instrument for right and wrong for both individuals and institutions. Social approval carried a load that was normally respected, and going away from the norms created by this load was unusual and not appreciated. This particular social load and requirements of approval of society created a framework for social and personal relationships and, consequently, for social fabrics.\\nThe last five years, approximately, have generalised the changes initiated from the very turn of the century. Society is moving very fast and so are its members. The catchment area of this dynamism is the young population who are much exposed to social media and the Internet. These platforms give information without having any link to epistemological and ontological roots. The young world is very vulnerable with a false confidence to negate the worth of validity of history and social experiences. This is not a general case with every young person but is true with almost everyone who has adopted to new way of life without self interrogation and evaluation of the consequences of adoption. I clarify that the intention is not to prove the young generation wrong or right in their chosen way or to be judgmental about their decisions. The sole purpose here is to showcase the different aspects of this newly generated world and to find an opinion on how far and how much we can accommodate and should accommodate.\\nGenerally speaking, Indian societies had a ‘belief system’ and that was common and obligatory for the members. I do not claim that there were no exceptions but at a larger scene, the system was followed. The belief in a god, in the provision of punishment in a metaphysical world, in commonly accepted morality, in subordination to the superior, in a particular way of socio-personal relation, to respect elders and to be embedded to society were some important aspects of the system. But in the recent past, tremendous changes have occurred and are clearly visible in society. The loads of morality have become insufficient to keep the members of society unmoved with the swing generated by modernity associated with a western glamour of openness.\\nThe most crucial change that can be noticed emerging in the last approximately 10 years is a ‘detachment from experience’. The young generation does not want to treat experience as its repository and to look to that in any struggle of the self. In all western and Indian traditions, experiences are the source of knowledge. Knowledge is one that guides the decision, and the young generation claims to have sufficient, real and required knowledge to decide. But it fails to accept the difference between information and knowledge. Information can work in attainment of immediate goals and those goals may turn stable also, but this is risky and is a function of probability and chance.\\nNow coming to the issue of change in ‘belief system’, of course, it is clearly visible. And I want to argue that this change is a natural dynamics of any social order and must be respected but only after critical examination. And these changes must be examined in respect to durability, stability, viability and the ultimate aim of a stress-free happy life.\\nIn the young world, morality today is conceived in terms of suitability and rationality as attainability. This has made the ‘immediate’ more important and desired than ‘stable’. Rational is good and good is happiness and happiness is an individual’s feeling. So every act or enactment is rational till it produces happiness to an individual. Today, rationality appears to be a stigma on a social face. I do agree that morality and rationality are often abused to justify and strengthen the hierarchy and subordination in society. So the fury of the young world against these concepts is understandable. But what is not understandable is their own creation of definitions but for the sole reason of their suitability. In these newly created groups of belief holders, historical convictions based on societal experiences are replaced by personal convictions based on immediate individual experiences, morality and rationality are replaced by suitability and attainability respectively, and knowledge as guiding factor for every decision is replaced by information.\\nThe entire exercise of creating a new ‘belief system’ and redefining concepts such as ‘morality’ and ‘rationality’ had ultimately the aim of a satisfactory, happy and good life. Satisfaction is word of infinite range having infinite variants. It is state of mind attached to achievements in every aspect of one’s life. Successful achievement is totally individualistic in a sense but absolutely social in realisation. This clearly means that it is relative and never absolute in nature. Being ‘satisfied’ also postulates being at the status of a totally desired achievement. Now we can safely reduce that ‘being satisfied is being stable’.\\nHappiness has been a basis for the organisation of society for schools of thought, particularly Hedonism. I will only say that happiness ultimately comes with a social face and can better be felt had and cherished in a society having defined characteristics of social living.\\n‘Good’ is another aspect of possible aspirations of new belief holders. John Rawls, one of the most recognised thinkers of contemporary world, tried to investigate the issue of priority between ‘good’ and ‘right’. The main arguments read as follows: The right must be given priority over good as it is an important aspect of justice. ‘Justice as Fairness’ requires that individual good be always integrated in right that comes from justice. Justice is good of society and more important and required than the good of individual. After scanning the “good” though history of political philosophy, the interesting point to note is that good was never considered to have an individualistic nature, it was always taken as social and was appreciated as social quality.\\nThe historical experiences confirm that a satisfied, happy and good life is possible only in a society. Collective living for immediate goals should not be recognised as cultural communities as it is neither desirable nor feasible. Thinking of a happy, satisfied and stable life without sociality may be mere imagination. Reformation from within should be welcome but not secession.\\nA.K. Upadhyay,\\nVaranasi',\n",
       " 'In my columns, I generally explain how I handle a specific complaint. In this column, I am compelled to break this norm and discuss two different complaints. This is because I had to skip writing a column on October 25, Ayudha Puja, as there was no edition on October 26. While addressing complaints, I see whether it is within my remit to do so or if there would be an overreach in my doing so.\\nAdvertisement policy\\nA complaint about an advertisement fell in the grey area between remit and overreach. Some readers, including K. Balakesari, former member, Railway Board, asked about the newspaper’s policy on accepting advertisements. They were uncomfortable with the publication of a full-page ad on behalf of the People’s Republic of China celebrating its national day on October 1. Mr. Balakesari asked: “Was it necessary for the paper to needlessly wade into a controversy by accepting an ad at this juncture from a country with which relations at present are far from normal, also knowing fully well that hardly anyone has the patience and time to wade through what is essentially propaganda?” He further asked: “Will the paper publish an ad from Pakistan on the eve of its national day extolling its achievements? Will you accept an ad from the RSS on the eve of its founding day?”\\nI must also record the fact that Mr. Balakesari’s mail came on October 18, and subsequent mails complaining about the Chinese ad that was published on October 1 came after October 19. As my remit ends with the editorial content of the newspaper and does not extend to advertisements, I am not familiar with the advertisement policy of the newspaper. I will talk to the management team and find out the advertising policy in place and share it with the readers as early as possible.\\nIn a polarised political environment, the dominant ideology always seeks to not only suppress other views but also obliterate the inherent nature of a plural society. In its desire to become exclusive, it tends to create a frighteningly monochromatic imagination that erases the multiple hues that make a society inclusive. With the series of electoral successes of strong leaders across nations, the binary between ‘an exclusive society’ and ‘an inclusive society’ becomes stark and the information ecosystem is not immune to this virus. Mails from a reader from Tiruchirappalli, S. Pushpavanam, are always critical and the tone and tenor of his missives are generally harsh.\\nMisogynism in texts\\nMr. Pushpavanam did not approve of the report “VCK buoyed by response to ‘ban Manusmriti’ campaign” (Tiruchirapalli edition, October 29). He asked what happened to the fact-check which I often mention in my column. His other arguments were: “This correspondent has not cited a single quote from the other side. It seems he is oblivious to the fact that there is another side. This is, by no standards, balanced journalism. The so-called buoyancy is from his own party men and from a Professor who is unheard of. The VCK leader’s speech has created disgust and aversion among the reading public. The correspondent has acted as a PRO of VCK. This is shoddy journalism and it could be a planted news item.”\\nI am not sure what is the other side Mr. Pushpavanam is referring to. If he means representing the votaries of Hindutva, which is vastly different from Hinduism, what he suggests is a false equivalence. Feminist scholars over the last five decades have documented the overt and covert patriarchy in the texts of various religions — be it Hinduism or Christianity or Islam. There is rich literature about the misogynism in the theocratic texts.\\nI was puzzled when he attached a letter in Tamil by a person whose opening line was: “I know neither Sanskrit nor Manusmriti” and who then cited Tamil translations of verses about women in the Manusmriti. Mr. Pushpavanam must realise that Dr. B.R. Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti on December 25, 1927. The erudite scholar who gave us our Constitution read multiple translations of the text before coming to the conclusion that the “Manusmriti dehumanised the Sudras, untouchables, and women, ruled the Hindu psyche for centuries and created the greatest obstacle to any serious attempt at eradicating the caste system.”\\nreaderseditor@thehindu.co.in',\n",

So, it comes as a surprise when business partners Justin K Abraham and Rakesh R say that their channel, LaLa Malayalam Kids Stories, has a blank, black screen when the narrator, LaLa tells a bedtime story, every day.\\n“This is our USP, we want children to listen to stories rather than watch them. Parents and children have come to expect that. We want to break the cycle,” they say, of their 22-day-old venture aimed at taking stories to children and reducing screen time.\\nEvery night, at 8 pm, a bedtime story is uploaded on the channel. Daily ‘viewer’ figures range from 1,000 to 2,000 views, and the channel has 13,000 followers.\\nRakesh’s seven-year-old son and his demands for a bedtime story gave the friends this idea. As they tossed it between them, they hit up on the no-video story-telling platform idea. “For close to four months, we tried variations in narration as research — with background score and without, with sound effects — ‘experimenting’ on our friends and their kids. We tweaked content and presentation based on feedback,” says Rakesh. They learnt interesting facts during the course of their research: for instance, it was parents who expected the accompanying videos and not the children.\\n“Children are okay with listening, in fact they are attentive, taking in the tiniest details,” says Justin. Although the stories were planned for five minutes each, parents suggested the duration be increased so that children fall asleep as they listened. This meant packing more content without changing the original storyline. “For example, in the story of the Fox and Grapes, we said the fox was a kid, who went out to play without footwear. We brought in, organically, relatable elements for children. The narration is deliberately slow so that children can visualise the scenes. We encourage active listening as opposed to passive listening which happens, for instance, when they watch television,” Rakesh says.\\nThe interactive content encourages listeners to repeat after LaLa, and stories are so structured that nuggets of information are provided — new words, what consists healthy behaviours/good manners. Children are asked to do activities such as drawing pictures or sing, videos of which are uploaded on their Instagram handle. While LaLa is a woman, there is a male character called NaNa. Actor Aju Varghese has lent his voice to this character, for three stories.\\n“We chose these names as our target audience comprises three to seven-year-olds, and NaNa and Lala are easy to pronounce. When NaNa (Aju) narrated the stories, a lot of kids related his voice to their father’s. Aju has been supportive of this venture,” Justin says.\\nJustin and Rakesh have got interesting feedback, mostly from Malayalis who live outside Kerala and overseas. “Since the narration is in Malayalam, parents say their children’s pronunciation is getting better and they are picking up the language,” says Justin.\\nReduced or no screen-time aside, there is another angle to their project. “This way, parents can spend time with their children. At the end of the day, all a child wants is to be with his parents and this is one way to do that without the usual distractions of technology,” Rakesh says.',\n",

       " 'Ever heard of the saying “Between a rock and a hard place”? It means there are dangers or troubles no matter which direction you go in. Perhaps this is what ancient Greek travellers felt like when they were caught between Scylla and Charybdis.\\nCharybdis, the daughter of the sea god Pontus and the earth goddess Gaia, was a deadly whirlpool. Three times a day, Charybdis would pull in and push out water with such force that ships would be sunk. Originally a beautiful girl, Charybdis was changed by the king of gods, Zeus, because she stole the cattle belonging to his son Hercules and helped his brother Poseidon increase the area under his control by flooding the land with water.\\nScylla, on the other hand, was a monster with six heads filled with sharp teeth and placed on long necks. Those sailors who came too close would be plucked off from their ships and eaten. She was the daughter of Phorycs and Ceto, deities of the sea who were also the parents of the Gorgons (remember Medusa from Perseus’ story?) and Graeae (three sisters who shared one eye and one tooth between them).\\nMonstrous transformation\\nThere are two stories of Scylla’s transformation into a monster. One, Poseidon’s wife Amphitrite was jealous of the nymph and poisoned the pool in which she bathed. Two, Glaucus, a sea god, fell in love with her and asked the sorceress Circe for a love potion. But Circe, who was in love with Glaucus herself, gave him a drink that turned Scylla into a monster.\\nScylla and Charybdis were said to live opposite each other in a strait of water today identified with the Straits of Messina between Sicily and Italy. No ship could pass that stretch without being attacked by either one of them. Interestingly, the movement of water in the Strait of Messina (which is between the Ionian and Tyrrhenian Seas) does cause a whirlpool but cannot damage modern ships.\\nThe two feature in many of the stories of Greek mythology. Jason and the Argonauts were the first to face them but, because Jason was favoured by Hera and Athena, the sea nymphs known as Nereids guided them and his friends past the dangerous duo.\\nOdysseus, another Greek hero, encounters them on his way back home from the Trojan War. The sorceress Circe — yes, the same one who turned Scylla into a monster — advises him to sail closer to Scylla rather than Charybdis and to get his sailors to row as fast as they can. Odysseus follows her advice and loses six sailors to Scylla but escapes Charybdis.',\n",

       " 'Ravi Subramanian’s first book, If God was a Banker, came out during the global financial crisis of 2007-08. Despite the crisis and his full-time job as a banker, he found the time and energy to write a novel. So, one assumes he would have done the same during the pandemic. After all, the lockdown must have allowed him more time. But he hasn’t.\\n“These are crazy times. It has been challenging to balance work and looking after one’s health. I know authors who are using this time to get their writing done. But I couldn’t. I need a clear mind and positive energy around me to write. And, that has been largely missing for the last six to seven months.”\\nThere were a few pending projects that Ravi managed to finish. The first book of his children’s mystery series, The SMS Detective Agency, was out on October 23. And, the first two books of Shortz, a series of crime novellas, which he is writing with unpublished authors, was released in September.\\nIs this an intentional departure from banking thrillers, which are Ravi’s forte?\\n“I didn’t strategise to write financial thrillers. I just happened to work in finance for over 20 years. So, I was familiar with that world. If you are a good writer, you should experiment. I did that with In The Name of God, which is about the Padmanabhaswamy temple in Kerala. It had nothing to do with finance. I am trying to do the same with Shortz and The SMS Detective Agency.”\\nSimple thrills\\nShortz, Ravi says, is a “T20 of thrillers.” Like the shortest format of cricket was devised to popularise the sport, Ravi’s Shortz is intended to get more people in India to read thrillers. “In India, many prefer romance or mythological fiction to thrillers. That is because people who are starting to read like simpler stories. And, the good thrillers have multiple plots and non-linear narratives. It can be a bit taxing, especially if it is a big book.” Shortz books, he says, are smaller and simpler.\\nAll 12 books in the series will feature an unpublished writer as Ravi’s co-author. “There are a lot of talented thriller writers in India. Shortz is an attempt to provide a platform for them.” Jigs Ashar, who co-wrote the first two books in the series, Insomnia and A Brutal Hand, won an award from Jeffrey Archer for his short story.\\n“Though I am a co-writer in this series, my role will be limited to edit the story and restructure the plot. The stories will be the other writers’. I try to keep their voice intact as well. The plot structure, however, will be similar to my books.”\\nThe OTT effect on reading\\nShortz, Ravi says, is also an attempt to get people who mainly consume OTT content to read. “Just a few years ago, you saw people travelling with a book on their hands. That has been replaced by phones now.”\\nRavi is aware he can’t change everyone. Even he binge-watches shows, which eats into his reading time. But he believes reading is better than watching films or a show. “When you read a book, you aren’t merely consuming the writer’s creativity; you are using yours as well to imagine the world that a writer has created. You don’t do that with OTT content. Reading lends balance; it contributes to culture.”\\nHe is also averse to writing for the screen. “When I write a book, I have a free hand. I write what I want to write; not what the reader wants to consume. But with a film or a TV series, you can’t always do that. There is big money involved. And, you ought to listen to the producers. Which is why I am not interested.”',\n",

But, this competition may lead to bias in prediction quality, according to a team of researchers at Stanford University.\\nOn websites like Netflix, algorithms work their way to provide accurate content recommendations. These algorithms also try to outdo those of Netflix's competitors, competing for clicks and associated user data.\\nWith time, the prediction algorithms become specialised for sub-populations that gravitate into their sites. The prediction models are then updated with new sets of data, depending on the preferences of new customers.\\nThis implies that the algorithms are actually changing the model to bias toward the new customers they have won over, the team said in a study titled 'Competing AI: How Does Competition Feedback Affect Machine Learning?'\\nAlso read | Text messages become new source of disinformation in U.S. Presidential Election\\nOver time, prediction algorithms become specialised for increasingly narrow slice of the population and the average quality of the predictions declines, the team noted.\\nThis happens because there is an optimal number of competitors that optimise user experience. Beyond that number, the artificial intelligent (AI) has access to data from a smaller fraction of users, reducing their ability to generate quality predictions.\\nThe disparity grows larger and larger with time and gets amplified due to the 'feedback dynamics of competition'.\\nIn search engines, when a user types in a query, the engine tries to predict what links would be most relevant to the user. But, if a competitor’s search engine does a better job at making those predictions, the user is likely to use that platform, which in turn alters the input in the machine learning system and changes the way it makes predictions in the future.\\nAlso read | Facebook's AI model can translate 100 languages without relying on English\\nThese theorems also apply to companies that predict users' credit risk. For example, a bank's algorithm may become very good at predicting the creditworthiness of a specific group of demographics.

       " \"Election Day is finally here.\\nOr at least what we still call Election Day, since nearly 100 million Americans had already cast ballots by Tuesday.\\nAlso read: U.S. Presidential election | In final stage, focus is on swing States\\nThat’s the result of an election system that has been reshaped by the worst pandemic in a century, prompting many voters to take advantage of advance voting rather than head to polling places in person at a time when coronavirus cases are rising.\\nHere’s what to watch as the final votes for President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden are cast:\\nWhat do Americans want from a President?\\nElections are always about where Americans want to steer the country. That’s especially true this year as the U.S. confronts multiple crises and is choosing between two candidates with very different visions for the future.\\nAlso read: U.S. presidential election: Trump vows to disprove polls, Biden urges 'take back our democracy'\\nMr. Trump has downplayed the coronavirus outbreak and panned governors — virtually all Democrats — who have imposed restrictions designed to prevent the spread of the disease.\\nHe has bucked public health guidelines by holding his signature campaign rallies featuring crowds of supporters — often unmasked — packed shoulder to shoulder.\\nAlso read: U.S. presidential elections | Trump vs Biden: 10 states to watch out for\\nMr. Biden has said he’d heed the advice of scientists. He’s pledged to work with state and local officials across the country to push mask mandates and has called on Congress to pass a sweeping response package.\\nThe candidates also hold distinctly different views on everything from climate change to taxes to racial injustice.\\n Mr. Trump cast protests over systemic racism across the U.S. this year as radical and has emphasized a law and order message to appeal to his largely white base. Biden acknowledges systemic racism, picked the first Black woman to appear on a major party’s presidential ticket and has positioned himself as a unifying figure.\\nWhose turnout approach wins?\\nThe two parties took wildly different approaches to contacting voters amid the pandemic.\\nAlso read: U.S. presidential election 2020 | Biden, Trump rallies show sharp contrast amid as coronavirus surges again\\nDemocrats stopped knocking on doors in the spring, going all-digital and phone. They resumed limited in-person contacts in September. Republicans continued traditional field work the entire campaign.\\nThe GOP can point to success in increasing their voter registration in battleground states. Democrats can point to their early voting success, including from notable slices of new voters. But only the final tally will vindicate one strategy or the other.\\nWill voting be peaceful?\\nEach major party can install official poll watchers at precincts. It’s the first time in decades Republicans could use the practice after the expiration of a court order limiting their activities.\\n So it’s an open question how aggressive those official poll watchers will be in monitoring voters or even challenging eligibility.\\nThe bigger issue is likely to be unofficial poll watchers — especially self-declared militias. Voter intimidation is illegal, but Trump, in the September 29 presidential debate, notably refused to state plainly that he’d accept election results and instead said he is urging my supporters to go into the polls and watch very carefully, because that’s what has to happen. I am urging them to do it.\\nIn Michigan, where federal authorities recently arrested members of anti-government paramilitary groups in an alleged plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic secretary of state tried to impose a ban on carrying firearms openly at a polling place. A Michigan judge struck down the order.\\nWhither the exurbs and smaller cities?\\nTrump’s reelection depends on driving up his margins in rural areas and smaller towns and cities — those expansive swaths of red on the county-by-county results map from 2016.\\nBut acres don’t vote, people do, and Biden is casting a wide demographic and geographic net. His ideal coalition is anchored in metro areas, but he hopes to improve Democratic turnout among nonwhite voters and college-educated voters across the map.\\nThere are places where the competing strategies overlap: exurban counties — those communities on the edges of the large metropolitan footprints — and counties anchored by smaller stand-alone cities.\\nBoth campaigns will be closely watching places like Forsyth County, Georgia, where 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney won 80 per cent of the vote but Trump’s share dropped 10 points, and Montgomery County, Ohio, which flipped from Democrat Barack Obama to Trump.\\nA 1968 redux? How about 1980?\\nTrump spent considerable energy this year posturing as a law and order president, seeking to replicate 1968, when widespread unrest in the U.S benefited Republican Richard Nixon as he built his silent majority.\\nBut Nixon wasn’t the incumbent in 1968. In fact, the political atmosphere was so bad for President Lyndon Johnson that the Democrat didn’t seek reelection.\\nMany Democrats and some Republicans are now pointing more at 1980, when Republican Ronald Reagan trounced President Jimmy Carter and the GOP flipped a whopping 12 Democratic Senate seats.\\nTrump’s standing in the polls over 2020 has tracked only slightly above where Carter spent much of the 1980 election year, as he battled inflation, high unemployment and the Iran hostage crisis.\\nBut what appeared a tight race on paper as late as October turned into a rout. Even Democratic heavyweights like Indiana Sen. Birch Bayh and South Dakota Sen. George McGovern, once a presidential nominee, fell.\\nIt’s a more polarized era four decades later. But the lesson is that Trump would defy history to win reelection amid such a cascade of crises and voter dissatisfaction.\",\n",

Fortunately, their provocation is falling on deaf ears since India has had a tradition of pluralism and co-existence where all communities live in harmony under a democratic framework.\\nIndia called on Pakistan to practice co-existence in their own country and eschew all sectarian violence, discrimination and intolerance against their own people.\\nMr. Sharma said the world today is confronted not only by the challenge of tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, but also the challenge of infodemic, which in many cases has been responsible for rise in hate speech and seeding hatred within communities.\\nIn June, India along with 12 countries co-sponsored the Cross-Regional Statement on Infodemic in the Context of COVID-19 — a first of its kind statement by UN Member States to counter the increase in hate speech and misinformation during the pandemic.\\nIndia is fighting COVID-19 pandemic in the most transparent manner with equal access to medical facilities to all citizens, Sharma said at the Third Committee meeting of the General Assembly, adding that special efforts have been taken to ensure that vulnerable communities are provided adequate medical support.',\n",

We are very proud of that.”\\nShe pointed out that her husband too had studied in his mother tongue (Italian). “He was also keen that our son study in a Kannada-medium school,” she said.\\nMs. Nanjundaswamy is happy with the impact the move has had on her son’s learning process. “He now speaks many languages, including Kannada, Italian, English, and Hindi,” she said, adding that he had never lagged behind on account of the medium of instruction. He is studying in a school run by noted poet G.S. Shivarudrappa’s son Jayadev, which focuses on life skills.\\nTrying to dispel the myth among parents that not studying in English-medium schools would be an hindrance to the child’s future, she said, “English is only a medium of learning. What is more important for the child’s future is his understanding and learning abilities.” She argued that the modern-day education system was more focused on creating a labour force rather than in the child’s personality development.',\n",
       " 'The campaigning for the local body elections is set to unfold when political hostilities appeared to be at an all-time high in the State.\\nThe Left Democratic Front (LDF) and its principal opponents, the Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), have accused each other of using the power of the State to target political rivals and their families personally.\\nThe Congress has protested against the move on the part of the government to resurrect the charge of rape levelled against its top leaders by the woman suspect in the solar investment fraud case that rocked the Oommen Chandy government in 2014.\\nLeader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala said the LDF seemed desperate to turn the conversation away from the ongoing investigation against Bineesh Kodiyeri and M.

Surendran said the government, impaired by the gold smuggling scandal, was facing unexpectedly strong political headwinds ahead of the local body and Assembly elections.\\nCentral investigations had come awkwardly close to the CPI(M) leadership and the government. Enforcement Directorate in Karnataka had zeroed in on Bineesh’s businesses and contacts in Kerala. Its office in Kochi had directed the State government to submit the details of at least four big projects promoted by Mr. Sivasankar at the behest of Mr. Vijayan.\\nMr. Vijayan was threatening the central agencies. He had unleashed the Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau (VACB) to impede ongoing investigations by the Central law enforcement into the shenanigans of the State government, Mr. Surendran said.\\nAt the same time, the government appeared to have laid the ground for a protracted legal battle over the limitations of Central authority and rights of States. It hoped to find common cause with other non-BJP ruled States, which have accused the Centre of jurisdictional overreach.\\nThe LDF is also poised to launch a major campaign to counter the adverse propaganda triggered by the gold smuggling case. It wants to go to the hustings leaning on the developmental achievements of the government and not by contrasting the vilification by the Congress and the BJP.

Vasudevan Nair and comprising filmmakers Harikumar, Kerala State Chalachitra Academy Chairman Kamal, actor Vidhubala, and Culture Secretary Rani George. The jury has observed that Hariharan has been at the forefront of transformations in the aesthetics of Malayalam cinema in a career spanning 50 years, during which he had made films that went on to become landmarks for the industry.\\nNewer avenues\\nEqually adept at contemporary narratives and large-scale historical productions, Hariharan has constantly explored newer avenues and stayed ahead of the game for much of his career. After reaching Chennai in 1965, he spent seven years assisting various directors before making his debut in 1972 with Ladies Hostel. Some of his earlier films, including Sharapancharam and Panchami, became stepping stones for Jayan to superstardom.\\nThe year 1986 witnessed the release of two of his best works — Panchagni, a woman-centric film set around the Naxalite movement, and Nakhakshathangal, which tackled teenage love, angst, and loss. Next year, he made Amrtham Gamaya, on a doctor ridden with guilt for a serious mistake he committed as a student.\\nHis first tryst with historical dramas came with Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha, which won four national awards. Parinayam was a period drama based on the practice of Smarthavicharam that existed in the early 20th century. He would return to period dramas much later in his career with Pazhassi Raja, which also proved to be a major hit. All of these films fetched awards at the national and State levels.\\nHis films have always been backed by some strong writing and also gifted Malayalam with some of its evergreen film songs.

       " '“A true fighter does not attack; he/she only defends,” says IV Sadiq, a porter at the Palayam market in Kozhikode, who represented India at the Muay Thai Pro Fight World Championship in Thailand in 2015.\\nMuay Thai is a way of life for Sadiq, who started training at 14. A martial art, which has its roots in Thailand, Muay Thai is known for its brute power. While Sadiq transforms into a fighting machine inside the ring, outside it, he says he consciously avoids a fight. For him, the real fight is within — to keep the spirit alive.\\nSadiq has won several medals at national championships. Well into his 30s, he now practises for about an hour or two every day and trains children. “Muay Thai is a combat sport that is extremely demanding. One is prone to injuries and it demands tremendous patience,” he says.\\nHis rather unusual balancing act — of being a porter and a Muay Thai boxer — has been captured on film by filmmakers Basim A Rahman and Sahis Abdul Sathar. The 10-minute eponymous short documentary traces Sadiq’s life.\\nBasim Arahman  \\nWhen Basim, who works as an assistant editor in films and Sahis, who is a video producer, were planning to make a narrative-style documentary, they heard of Sadiq and felt it could be the ideal subject for a non-fiction documentary. “Sadiq’s humble background and his devotion to the sport makes his story truly inspirational. We decided to go ahead with the project,” says Basim.\\nSahis Abdul Sathar  \\nThey visited Sadiq at his home in Perumanna and got him on board. However, filming was not easy. “Sadiq is a very busy man. He could only come for the filming in between his work at the market,” says Basim. The shooting, which started in November 2019 moved rather slowly, and COVID-19 delayed it further. “We even thought we would have to shelve it, we were determined to complete it,” Basim adds.\\nThe filmmkers, however, feel they could not do full justice to the subject. “Shooting in the market was challenging because of pandemic restrictions. There were financial constraints too,” says Basim. Talks are on to make a film on Sadiq, he adds.\\nSadiq does not analyse his journey so far; he believes in keeping up his training. “As a child, I used to observe my cousin brother training in Muay Thai and was inspired. I always wanted to learn it and be better than him,” says Sadiq. He learnt the basics of the martial art under Kozhikode-based Muay Thai trainer Sivakumar VP.\\nThe fire within\\n“Going to Thailand to represent India was a dream. I won only a silver, but it was an unforgettable experience as Thailand is the home of Muay Thai,” says Sadiq.\\nMuay Thai is considerably different from kickboxing, explains Sadiq. “It is not just the fists. Muay Thai is known as an art of eight limbs. You use the fists, the elbows, the shins and the knees in the fight. It teaches you how the human body can be used as a weapon.”\\nAt the championship in Thailand  \\nHis day job as a head-load worker has only supported his passion. “While others might have to constantly work out to remain fit, most of my workout comes through my job, which involves carrying huge loads. 50% to 70 % of the stamina comes from there,” he says.\\nSadiq cannot imagine remaining idle. The pandemic did put breaks on his routine and it was rough. “The muscles loosen. The mind loses its strength. I have to keep training. That’s what I do best,” he says.\\nHe currently devotes more time to training children. “If I could inspire at least one child to follow his or her dream to be a Muay Thai boxer, I would consider myself successful,” he adds.\\nThe documentary is currently available on YouTube:\\nhttps://youtu.be/RqzCvYEf0z4',\n",

All the same, Ignite — From Within the Confines essentially instils hope,” says Deepa.\\nExcerpts from an e-mail interview.\\nWhat led you to curate this show?\\nThe objective is simple; I wanted to promote art and poetry, and I was particularly interested in the collaboration. It was experimental and to my surprise, most artistes were as excited as I was when I reached out.\\nThis was one of my pet projects; I had been thinking of such a collaboration for some time. When everything turned online, I saw the possibility of such a show.\\nHow did you get these artists together? Have you worked with them before?\\nI knew most of them for a long time and have been following their works. I have also worked/participated with a few of them before like German, Ahlam, Liz and Devan sir. German and Ahlam were part of my earlier show, Repercussions, which I curated in 2016 at Durbar Hall, Kochi. I checked with a couple of artist/poet friends regarding the works they did since the pandemic. I got in touch with them, and most of them were immediately on board.\\nHow open were the artists, to working within the ‘confines’ of a theme?\\nI don’t think they gave a second thought about the ‘confines’ since all of them were creating/writing during this time, venting using various forms of expression; not necessarily speaking about the pandemic alone. They were in their zones tapping into their creative energy and producing works that mattered to them.\\nWhen I paired them, all the poets were excited to see the works and respond. There were no restrictions other than that the poets needed to write at least one to five poems based on the respective artist’s works that I sent to them. Some of us interacted with those we were paired with, some could not and some did not (as they felt that they would be influenced and that would sway the writing).\\nWhat were the challenges involved?\\nEvery day has been a learning experience for me. Bringing all participants together under one umbrella has its own challenges. Not everyone thinks alike; since the interaction was virtual, communication was difficult at times. The varying time zones added to the difficulty sometimes.\\nThe show will be inaugurated at https://ignitefromwithintheconfines.blogspot.com/ on November 4, 4 pm.

He is also completely silent on the prospects of warming up to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) or floating an outfit of his own.\\nMr. Adhikari, has been with Ms. Banerjee from the very start of the Trinamool Congress. He played a crucial and deciding role in the Nandigram movement when the struggle against forcible land acquisition by farmers in Purba Medinipur district rattled the Left Front government in 2007-08.\\nHe has been elected to Lok Sabha and now holds the portfolio of State’s Transport Department.\\nHis father Sisir Adhikari and brother Dibyendu Adhikari are Lok Sabha MPs from the district.\\nThe BJP leadership in the State has gone on record saying that he is welcome to join them. “As a youth leader I will urge him to join us and work for the people,” Soumitra Khan BJP MP and president of State’s Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha said.

It was further proof that the women’s game was getting more and more popular in the country.\\nAlso read: Women’s T20 Challenge | Mithali Raj prepped to don role of mentor\\nFemale cricketers, from around the globe, will, of course, have to play before empty stands in the third edition of the Women’s T20 Challenge, which opens at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. They, however, would be relieved that they are getting to play some cricket after all in these troubled times; many of them haven’t got a game for eight months.\\nImportant event\\n Within two years, the Women’s T20 Challenge — considered a precursor to the possible women’s IPL — has evolved as an important event on the international calendar. It attracts the best cricketers from around the world and has unearthed fresh Indian talent, like Shafali Varma, who was a revelation last year.\\n She was 15 then, but had impressed with her stroke-making abilities. She is now an integral part of the Indian team and hit the highest number of sixes at the Women’s T20 World Cup last year.\\nAlso read: Jio named title sponsor of Women’s T20 Challenge\\nShe will be one of the players to watch out for in this tournament, too.

I’m sure the guys will be excited about what’s ahead for us.

There are going to be learnings along the way, but we are glad that we are through.”\\nThey lost a number of matches but Kohli said they deserved to be in top-4.\\n“It’s a mixed bag. As I said at the toss, you come to games to try and get the result your way. We are happy that we’ve qualified. Top two would’ve been very really nice. But I think we’ve played good enough cricket to earn a qualification spot,” said.\\nKohli said they were made aware by the team management that they need to force the match beyond 17.3 overs and they did well to manage that with some superb middle overs bowling.\\n“Even if the game’s drifting away from you, we controlled that middle phase really well where they could have taken the game away from us.”\\nRCB will have to wait and watch who they face — Sunrisers Hyderabad or Kolkata Knight Riders — in the eliminator.\\n“You could say just before the qualification, the mindset was a little bit tentative. We’ve got two games to reach the final.”\\nAsked about injured pacer Navdeep Saini and all-rounder Chris Morris, who walked off the field after bowling just two overs, the skipper said the duo will have to be assessed.\\n“We’ll have to asses what’s happening, hopefully they’ll be fine by the time we play our next game.
